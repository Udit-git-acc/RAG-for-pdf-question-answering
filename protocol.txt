Lymphoma (ZUMA-1). 
Indication 
The indication is for the treatment of adult subjects with relapsed or 
refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal 
B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL), 
and high grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) after two or more lines of 
systemic therapy. 
Study Design 
Study KTE-C19-101 is a Phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label study 
evaluating the safety and efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel in subjects 
with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).  
The trial will be separated into 3 distinct phases designated as the 
Phase 1 study, Phase 2 pivotal study (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2), and 
Phase 2 safety management study (Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and 
Cohort 6). 
Phase 1 Study 
During Phase 1 study, approximately 6 to 24 subjects with DLBCL, 
PMBCL, or TFL will be enrolled to evaluate the safety of axicabtagene 
ciloleucel regimens.  A safety review team (SRT), internal to the study 
sponsor, will review the safety data and make recommendations on 
further study conduct of Phase 1 and progression to Phase 2 pivotal study 
as depicted in Figure 3 and outlined in Section 9.10.  
Phase 2 Pivotal Study 
In the Phase 2 pivotal study, approximately 92 subjects will enroll into 
2 separate cohorts designated as Cohort 1 and Cohort 2: 
 Cohort 1 will enroll approximately 72 adult subjects with refractory 
DLBCL. 
 Cohort 2 will enroll approximately 20 adult subjects with refractory 
PMBCL and TFL. TFL is defined as subjects who received prior 
therapy for follicular lymphoma.

Study Eligibility 
Please refer to Section 5 for a complete and detailed list of inclusion and 
exclusion criteria for both phases of the study.  
Treatment 
Investigational Product: 
 Axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment consists of a single infusion of 
CAR transduced autologous T cells administered intravenously at a 
target dose of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg.  For subjects 
weighing greater than 100 kg, a maximum flat dose of 
2 x 108 anti-CD19 CAR T cells will be administered.  Under 
circumstances where subjects initially respond and subsequently 
relapse, subjects may be eligible for a second course of conditioning 
chemotherapy and axicabtagene ciloleucel.  Refer to Section 6 for 
treatment and Section 7.13.9 for retreatment details. 
Bridging Therapy (Phase 2 Safety Management Study) 
 At the discretion of the investigator, bridging therapy may be 
considered for subjects particularly with high disease burden at 
screening or baseline assessment (eg, bulky disease or rapidly 
progressing disease). 
 For subjects receiving bridging therapy, refer to Section 6 for 
bridging therapy details. 
Debulking Therapy (Phase 2 Safety Management Study, Cohort 5) 
 Debulking therapy should be applied to all subjects enrolled in 
Cohort 5 with the aim of reducing lymphoma burden. Debulking 
therapy is to be administered after leukapheresis and prior to 
administration of conditioning chemotherapy or axicabtagene 
ciloleucel. 
 Refer to Section 6.2.2 for debulking therapy details 
Conditioning Chemotherapy 
 Axicabtagene ciloleucel is administered after a conditioning 
chemotherapy regimen consisting of fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day and 
cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day, administered x 3 days.  Refer to 
Section 6 for chemotherapy treatment details. 
Additional axicabtagene ciloleucel regimens may be explored in Phase 1 
per Section 9.10.

Phase 2 Safety Management Study 
 Subjects assigned to Cohort 3 will receive the same conditioning 
chemotherapy and axicabtagene ciloleucel regimen as described above 
and will also receive prophylactic tocilizumab and levetiracetam for 
toxicity management as outlined in Section 6.3.4 and Section 6.4. 
 Subjects assigned to Cohort 4 will receive the same conditioning 
chemotherapy and axicabtagene ciloleucel regimen as described 
above, but toxicity management will intervene at lower grades of CRS 
and neurologic toxicities as outlined in Section 6.4.1. 
 Subjects assigned to Cohort 5 will receive the same conditioning 
chemotherapy and axicabtagene ciloleucel regimen as other safety 
management cohorts; toxicity management will be completed as 
outlined in Section 6.4.2. 
 Subjects assigned to Cohort 6 will receive the same conditioning 
chemotherapy and axicabtagene ciloleucel regimen as described 
above 
;  toxicity management 
will intervene at lower grades of CRS and neurologic toxicities as 
outlined in Section 6.4.1. 
Procedures 
At specific time points as outlined in the schedule of assessments, subjects 
will undergo the following assessments/procedures: collection of informed 
consent, general medical history including previous treatments for NHL, 
physical exam including vital signs and performance status, neurologic 
assessments, blood draws for complete blood count (CBC), chemistry 
panels, cytokines, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte subsets, anti-
axicabtagene ciloleucel antibodies, replication-competent retrovirus 
(RCR) and anti-CD19 CAR T cell analysis. Women of childbearing 
potential will undergo a urine or serum pregnancy test.  
Subjects will also undergo a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG), 
echocardiogram (ECHO), brain magnetic resonance image (MRI), a 
positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT), possible 
bone marrow aspirate/biopsy and leukapheresis. 
Subjects assigned to Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6 will 
complete the EQ-5D questionnaire at baseline and after axicabtagene 
ciloleucel (see Section 7.4 and schedule of assessments [SOA]) infusion 
and will have lumbar punctures performed for the collection of 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (see Section 7.9 and SOA) before and after 
axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. 
Routinely throughout the conduct of the study, subjects will be asked to 
report concomitant medications and adverse events and will have their 
disease assessed.

Safety Review 
Team and Data 
Safety Monitoring 
Board 
An SRT, that is internal to the study sponsor and in collaboration with at 
least one study investigator, will review safety data in Phase 1 of the 
study.  The SRT will review the safety data and make recommendations 
on further study conduct of Phase 1 and progression to Phase 2 as depicted 
in Figure 3 and outlined in Section 9.10.   
Phase 2 Pivotal Study:  An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) will meet when 20 and 50 subjects in the modified intent-to-treat 
(mITT) set of Cohort 1 have had the opportunity to complete their 3 
month disease assessment. The DSMB will review safety and efficacy 
data and be chartered to make trial conduct recommendations based on an 
analysis of risk vs. benefit.  
Phase 2 Safety Management Study:  The DSMB will meet to review 
Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6 safety data when 20 subjects 
in each cohort have been treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel and have 
had the opportunity to be followed for 30 days. The DSMB may meet 
more often as needed. Refer to Section 9.11 and Section 9.12. 
Statistical 
Considerations 
Phase 1 Study 
The primary endpoint for the Phase 1 study is the incidence of DLT. 
Phase 2 Pivotal Study 
The primary endpoint for the Phase 2 pivotal study (Cohort 1 and 
Cohort 2) of the study is objective response rate per the revised IWG 
Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al, 2007) as 
determined by the study investigators. This endpoint will be based on a 
modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population consisting of all subjects 
enrolled and treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel at a dose of at least 
1 X 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg. 
This study uses a single-arm design to test for an improvement in response 
rate 
 
.  For the test of efficacy this study has ≥ 90% power to distinguish 
between an active therapy with a 40% true response rate from a therapy 
with a response rate of 20% or less with a 1-sided alpha level of 0.025.

OBJECTIVES 
The primary objective of Phase 1 study is to evaluate the safety of axicabtagene ciloleucel 
regimens.   
The primary objective of Phase 2 pivotal study is to evaluate the efficacy of axicabtagene 
ciloleucel, as measured by objective response rate (ORR) in subjects with diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed 
follicular lymphoma (TFL).  Secondary objectives will include assessing the safety and 
tolerability of axicabtagene ciloleucel and additional efficacy endpoints.   
The primary objective of the Phase 2 safety management study is to assess the impact of a 
prophylactic regimen, earlier interventions, debulking therapy, or prophylactic steroid use on 
the rate and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicities.  The key 
secondary objectives include assessment of efficacy, levels of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen 
receptor (CAR) T cells, cytokines in blood/serum, and the change in European Quality of Life-5 
Dimensions (EQ-5D) scores from baseline to Month 6.

DISEASE BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a heterogeneous group of cancers originating in B 
lymphocytes, T lymphocytes or natural killer cells.  In the United States, B cell lymphomas 
represent 80-85% of cases reported.  In 2013, approximately 69,740 new cases of NHL and over 
19,000 deaths related to the disease were estimated to occur.  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the 
most prevalent hematological malignancy and is the seventh leading site of new cancers among 
men and women and account for 4% of all new cancer cases and 3% of deaths related to cancer 
(Howlader et al, 2017).  Large B-cell lymphomas represent the most common sub-group of NHL 
(Rodriguez-Abreu et al, 2007). 
2.1. 
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma 
DLBCL is the most common subtype of large B-cell lymphoma, accounting for approximately 
30% of NHL cases.  There are approximately 22,000 new diagnoses of DLBCL in the United 
States each year.  In the past two decades, progress has been made in understanding the 
biological heterogeneity of DLBCL and in improving survival with combinations of CHOP and 
immunotherapy.  The addition of rituximab into combination therapies for DLBCL have greatly 
improved patient outcomes.  However, patients with chemotherapy-refractory DLBCL following 
treatment under the current standards of care still have a particularly dire prognosis, with no 
curative treatment options (Flowers et al, 2010). 
The population with the highest unmet need continues to consist of patients who do not respond 
to first line combination chemotherapy (typically R-CHOP) or who do not respond to their last 
course of combination chemotherapy, as the disease is mostly insensitive to subsequent 
combination chemotherapy (typically R-ICE, R-ESHAP) (Table 1).  In a review of 64 patients 
with DLBCL with disease progression during first line chemotherapy or only transient response 
(≤90 days) after end of induction treatment, the response rate to second line therapy was 
15% and the median overall survival (OS) was 6 months, and no patient survived more than 
26 months after first diagnosis (Josting et al, 2000).  An analysis of outcome in 1126 patients 
with DLBCL after first line R-CHOP included 33 patients with primary refractory DLBCL who 
received second line therapy with curative intent.  Only 3 (9%) patients were able to receive 
autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), and only 1 (3%) patient achieved long term 
survival (Hitz et al, 2010).  Seshadri et al analyzed 120 patients who did not respond to 
second line platinum-based chemotherapy regimens (e.g., R-ICE) and showed that only 
14% responded to their third line therapy (Seshadri et al, 2008).  Ardeshna et al followed 
19 patients with large B-cell lymphoma, and 9 patients with TFL who did not respond to 
second line chemotherapy.  Only 5 of the 28 total patients (18%) responded to third line 
chemotherapy (Ardeshna et al, 2005).

These consistently discouraging results demonstrate that new treatment options are urgently 
needed for patients whose tumors have demonstrated a lack of response to chemotherapy.   
This trial will enroll patients with chemo-refractory lymphoma, as evidenced by failure to 
achieve even a transient or partial response to prior biologic and combination chemotherapy or 
by early recurrence after ASCT. 
2.2. 
Primary Mediastinal B-cell Lymphoma and Transformed Follicular 
Lymphoma 
PMBCL has distinct clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics compared to DLBCL.  
PMBCL is thought to arise from thymic (medullary) B cells and represents approximately 3% of 
patients diagnosed with large B-cell lymphoma.  PMBCL is typically identified in the younger 
adult population in the fourth decade of life with a slight female predominance (Sehn et al, 1998; 
Savage et al, 2006).  Gene expression profiling suggests deregulated pathways in PMBCL 
overlap with Hodgkin lymphoma.  Initial therapy of PMBCL generally includes anthracycline-
containing regimens with rituximab with or without involved field radiotherapy.  A recent 
Phase 2, prospective study of infusional dose-adjusted etoposide, doxorubicin, and 
cyclophosphamide with vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) demonstrated 
radiotherapy may not be required (Dunleavy et al, 2013).

Follicular lymphoma (FL), a B cell lymphoma, is the most common indolent (slow-growing) 
form of NHL, accounting for approximately 20% to 30% of all NHLs.  Some patients with FL 
will transform (TFL) histologically to DLBCL which is more aggressive and associated with a 
poor outcome.  Histological transformation to DLBCL occurs at an annual rate of approximately 
3% for 15 years with the risk of transformation continuing to drop in subsequent years.  The 
biologic mechanism of histologic transformation is unknown.  Initial treatment of TFL is 
influenced by prior therapies for follicular lymphoma but generally includes 
anthracycline-containing regimens with rituximab to eliminate the aggressive component of the 
disease (National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2014). 
Treatment options for relapsed/refractory PMBCL and TFL are similar to those in DLBCL.  
Given the low prevalence of these diseases, no large prospective randomized studies in these 
patient populations have been conducted.  Patients with chemotherapy refractory disease have a 
similar or worse prognosis (Kuruvilla et al, 2008) to those with refractory DLBCL. 
In addition, the international, multicohort retrospective non-Hodgkin lymphoma research 
(SCHOLAR-1) study retrospectively evaluated outcomes in patients with chemorefractory 
DLBCL, PMBCL, and TFL.  SCHOLAR-1 integrated data from two Phase 3 studies 
(LYSARC-CORAL and Canadian Cancer Trials Group LY.12) and 2 observational cohorts 
(MD Anderson Cancer Center and Mayo Clinic/University of Iowa Specialized Program of 
Research Excellence).  Among 861 patients, 635 were included based on chemorefractory search 
criteria.  Outcomes were consistently poor, regardless of refractory subgroup and across cohorts.  
The results of SCHOLAR-1 indicated that patients with chemorefractory, aggressive DLBCL 
represent a homogenous patient population with a response rate of 26% (complete response [CR] 
rate of 7%) and median overall survival of 6.3 months (Crump et al, 2017). 
2.3. 
High Grade B-cell Lymphoma  
In 2016, the World Health Organization introduced a new category of large B-cell lymphomas 
called high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) (Swerdlow et al, 2016).  This designation includes 
large B-cell lymphomas with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements that are 
phenotypically intermediate to DLBCL or B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable (this latter category 
has since been eliminated).  MYC rearrangements in large B-cell lymphomas are associated with 
a poor prognosis that is worsened in cases of concomitant BCL2 and/or BCL6 alterations, 
ie, double- or triple-hit lymphomas.  As such, patients with HGBCL are likely to face poor 
survival outcomes. 
In summary, axicabtagene ciloleucel may provide a viable treatment option to relapsed/refractory 
large B-cell lymphoma patients with no other curative alternatives. 
2.4. 
Study Rationale 
As most advanced cancers eventually become refractory to conventional therapies, new 
treatment modalities are needed.  Immunotherapy, which is based on the enhancement of an 
immune response against the tumor, is a promising approach to treating many cancer types.  
T cells play an important role in destroying diseased cells throughout the body.  Studies with 
immune checkpoint inhibitors and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes have demonstrated the

potential of T cells to treat cancer.  T cells need to possess the appropriate specificity for a tumor, 
be present in sufficient numbers, and overcome any local immunosuppressive factors to be 
effective.  Engineered T cells are a promising approach for cancer therapy (Kershaw et al, 2013). 
Engineered autologous cell therapy (eACT™) is a process by which a patient’s own T cells are 
collected and subsequently genetically altered to recognize and target antigens expressed on the 
cell surface of specific malignancies (Kochenderfer et al, 2013).  The ability to genetically 
engineer human T cells and use them to mediate cancer regression in patients has been 
demonstrated in a number of studies and has opened possibilities for the treatment of patients 
with a wide variety of cancer types including B cell malignancies expressing the CD19 antigen. 
2.4.1. 
CD19 and Expression 
CD19 is a 95 kDa transmembrane protein expressed only in the B cell lineage.  It is expressed in 
all normal B cells starting at the pre-B cell stage until the final differentiation stage and is not 
expressed in pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells or most plasma cells.  The pattern of CD19 
expression is maintained in B cell malignancies including all subtypes of B cell NHL, chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and non-T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Blanc et al, 
2011) with the exception of multiple myeloma. 
2.4.2. 
Anti-CD19 CAR T-cell Product 
Anti-CD19 CAR T cells are autologous human T cells that have been engineered to express an 
extracellular single-chain variable fragment (scFv) with specificity for CD19 linked to an 
intracellular signaling part comprised of signaling domains from CD28 and CD3ζ (CD3-zeta) 
molecules arranged in tandem.  
An anti-CD19 CAR vector construct has been designed, optimized and initially tested at the 
Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute (NCI, IND 13871) (Figure 2) (Kochenderfer et 
al, 2009; Kochenderfer et al, 2010).  The scFv is derived from the variable region of the 
anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody FMC63 (Nicholson et al, 1997).  A portion of the CD28 
costimulatory molecule is added, as murine models suggest this is important for the anti-tumor 
effect and persistence of anti-CD19 CAR T cells (Kowolik et al, 2006).  The signaling domain of 
the CD3-zeta chain is essential for T cell activation.  These fragments were cloned into the 
murine stem 
 vector, utilized to genetically engineer the autologous T 
cells.  Treatment with anti-CD19 CAR T cells is currently being administered to subjects with 
CD19+ B cell malignancies in ongoing NCI protocol (09-C-0082; IND 13871).  
 
 
The CAR construct is inserted into the T cells’ genome by retroviral vector transduction.  
Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are obtained by leukapheresis and Ficoll 
separation.  
 
  Stimulated cells are transduced 
with a retroviral vector containing an anti-CD19 CAR gene and propagated in culture to generate 
sufficient engineered T cells for administration.

STUDY DESIGN 
3.1. 
General Study Design 
Study KTE-C19-101 is a Phase 1-2 multicenter, open-label study evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel in subjects with refractory NHL.  Study KTE-C19-101 will 
be separated into 3 distinct phases designated as Phase 1 study, Phase 2 pivotal study (Cohort 1 
and Cohort 2), and Phase 2 safety management study (Cohort 3,Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and 
Cohort 6). 
Phase 1 Study 
During Phase 1, approximately 6 to 24 subjects with DLBCL, PMBCL, or TFL will be enrolled 
to evaluate the safety of axicabtagene ciloleucel regimens.  If the initial regimen is determined to 
be safe, a higher dose of conditioning chemotherapy may be investigated.  If the regimen is 
determined to not be safe, reduced doses of conditioning chemotherapy and/or axicabtagene 
ciloleucel may be explored.  A safety review team (SRT), internal to the study sponsor, will 
review the safety data and make recommendations on further study conduct of Phase 1 and 
progression to Phase 2 as depicted in Figure 3 and outlined in Section 9.10.

Phase 2 Pivotal Study 
In Phase 2 pivotal study, subjects will enroll into 2 separate cohorts designated as Cohort 1 and 
Cohort 2. 
 Cohort 1 will enroll adult subjects with refractory DLBCL.  
 Cohort 2 will enroll adult subjects with refractory PMBCL and TFL. 
 TFL is defined as subjects who received prior chemotherapy for follicular lymphoma. 
During the Phase 2 pivotal study, an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will 
meet when 20 and 50 subjects in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) set of Cohort 1 have had the 
opportunity to complete the 3 month disease assessment.  The DSMB will review safety and 
efficacy data and be chartered to make trial conduct recommendations based on an analysis of 
risk vs. benefit.   
Phase 2 Safety Management Study (SMS) 
In the Phase 2 safety management study (SMS), subjects will enroll into 4 separate cohorts 
designated as Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6.  
 Cohort 3 will enroll adult subjects with relapsed or refractory transplant ineligible DLBCL, 
PMBCL, or TFL. 
 Cohort 4 will enroll adult subjects with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, PMBCL, TFL, or 
HGBCL after 2 systemic lines of therapy. 
 Cohort 5 will enroll adult subjects with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, PMBCL, TFL, or 
HGBCL after 2 systemic lines of therapy. 
 Cohort 6 will enroll adult subjects with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, PMBCL, TFL, 
or HGBCL after 2 systemic lines of therapy. 
The DSMB will meet to review safety data when 20 subjects in each Cohort 3, Cohort 4, 
Cohort 5, and Cohort 6 have been treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel and have had the 
opportunity to be followed for 30 days.  The DSMB may meet more often as needed. 
Independent of the phase of the study each subject will follow the same study treatment schedule 
and procedural requirements. Each subject will proceed through the following study periods: 
 Screening period 
 Enrollment/Leukapheresis period 
 Bridging therapy (if applicable, for Phase 2 SMS) or debulking therapy (if applicable, 
Phase 2 SMS, Cohort 5)

3.4. 
Replacement of Subjects 
Subjects will continue to be enrolled until the specified number of subjects are attained in the 
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluable (Phase 1) and mITT sets (Phase 2).  Subjects who have 
not received the target dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel will be retained in the analyses of 
disposition and safety, where appropriate (Section 10.5). 
3.5. 
Study Duration 
3.5.1. 
Study Duration for Individual Subjects  
The duration of the study for individual subjects will vary.  For a subject who completes the 
entire protocol from the date of informed consent through the completion of the long term 
follow-up period, the duration of the study will take approximately 15 years to complete.  
However, individual study duration will vary depending on a subject’s screening requirements, 
response to treatment and survival.  
The need for prolonged follow-up is based on the potential persistence of gene transfer vectors in 
treated subjects. 
3.5.2. 
Completion of the Phase 2 Pivotal Study 
Completion of the study is defined as the time at which the last subject completes the long-term 
follow-up period visit, is considered lost to follow-up, withdraws consent, or dies.  The primary 
analyses will be conducted when 72 subjects in the mITT set of the Phase 2 pivotal Cohort 1 and 
20 subjects in the mITT set of Cohort 2 have completed the 6 month disease response 
assessment, are lost to follow-up, withdraw from the study, or die, whichever occurs first.

SUBJECT SCREENING AND ENROLLMENT 
All subjects must sign and date the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IRB/IEC) approved consent form before initiating any study specific procedures or activities 
that are not part of a subject’s routine care.  Refer to Section 7 for details. 
Each subject who enters the screening period, which starts when the subject signs the informed 
consent form (ICF), will receive a unique subject identification (ID) number before any study 
specific procedures or activities are initiated.  This number will be used to identify the subject 
throughout the study and must be used on all study documentation related to the subject.  
Furthermore, the subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire 
clinical study, it must not be changed after enrollment or if the subject is rescreened or retreated.

6.2.5. 
Concomitant Therapy 
During the course of the study, investigators may prescribe any concomitant medications or 
treatment deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except those medications listed 
in Section 6.2.6. 
All concurrent therapies, including medications, intubation, dialysis, oxygen, and blood products, 
will be recorded from the date of the informed consent through 3 months after completing 
treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel.  After 3 months of follow-up, only targeted concomitant 
medication will be collected for 24 months after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion or disease 
progression, whichever occurs first.  Targeted concomitant medications include gammaglobulin, 
immunosuppressive drugs, anti-infective drugs, and vaccinations.   
For subjects who are enrolled but not dosed with axicabtagene ciloleucel, concurrent therapies 
will only be recorded from the date of the informed consent through 30 days after the last study 
specific procedure (e.g., leukapheresis, conditioning chemotherapy).  For subjects who are not 
enrolled (e.g., screen failure or not leukapheresed), only concurrent therapies related to any 
serious adverse event(s) will be recorded. 
Specific concomitant medication collection requirements and instructions are included in the 
case report form (CRF) completion guidelines. 
6.2.6. 
Excluded Medications 
Corticosteroid therapy at a pharmacologic dose (≥ 5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent doses of 
other corticosteroids) and other immunosuppressive drugs must be avoided for 7 days prior to 
leukapheresis, and 5 days prior to axicabtagene ciloleucel administration. For the prophylactic 
use of steroid for Cohort 6, refer to Section 7.13.7.   
Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs should also be avoided for 3 months after 
axicabtagene ciloleucel administration, unless used to manage axicabtagene ciloleucel related 
toxicities (refer to the most current version of the IB).  Other medications that might interfere 
with the evaluation of the investigational product, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents 
should also be avoided for the same time period unless medically necessary.

6.3. 
Study Treatment Schedule 
6.3.1. 
Leukapheresis (Within Approximately 5 Days of Eligibility Confirmation) 
Subjects will undergo leukapheresis to obtain leukocytes (white blood cells) for the 
manufacturing of axicabtagene ciloleucel.  Leukapheresed cells obtained at participating centers 
will be shipped to the cell processing facility (CPF) overnight as described in the Investigational 
Product Manual.  Once a subject commences leukapheresis, the subject is considered enrolled in 
the study. 
Mononuclear cells will be obtained by leukapheresis (
 with a goal to target 
 mononuclear cells).  The leukapheresed cells are then packaged for 
expedited shipment to the CPF as described in the investigational product manual.  
Upon arrival at the CPF, each subject’s leukapheresed product will be processed to enrich for the 
T cells containing PBMC fraction.  T cells are then stimulated to expand and transduced with a 
retroviral vector to introduce the CAR gene.  The T cells are then expanded and cryopreserved to 
generate the investigational product per CPF standard operating procedures (SOPs).  Once the 
product has passed certain release tests, it will be shipped back to the treating facility.  Following 
completion of each subject’s conditioning chemotherapy regimen, subjects will receive their 
respective axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.

Study Treatment  
6.3.2.1. 
Chemotherapy General Instructions 
Subjects will receive a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide 
and fludarabine in order to induce lymphocyte depletion and create an optimal environment for 
expansion of axicabtagene ciloleucel in vivo.  Subjects will initiate conditioning chemotherapy 
with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine beginning on Day -5 (or Day -7 for Cohort B) through 
Day -1.  The 5-day conditioning chemotherapy regimen may be administered in an outpatient 
setting.  The 7-day conditioning chemotherapy regimen may be administered as an outpatient or 
inpatient regimen per investigator’s discretion.  
Subjects should be instructed to drink plenty of liquids during and for 24 hours following the 
chemotherapy.  In general, subjects should be kept well-hydrated but closely monitored to 
prevent fluid overload.  
For subjects enrolled into the Phase 2 Safety Management Study, Cohort 5 and Cohort 6: 
Subjects who have not recovered their white blood cell (WBC) count by the time conditioning 
chemotherapy is scheduled to start, may skip the conditioning chemotherapy if the WBC is 
≤ 1000/µL at this time. This option must be discussed with the Kite medical monitor.  
6.3.2.2. 
Axicabtagene Ciloleucel General Instructions 
All subjects will receive axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion at a healthcare facility, followed by 
daily monitoring at a healthcare facility for at least 7 days unless otherwise required by country 
regulatory agencies (refer to Appendix B) to monitor for signs and symptoms of CRS and 
neurologic toxicities.  Subjects should be instructed to remain within proximity of the clinical 
study site for at least 4 weeks following axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  Subjects and their 
family members/caregivers should be educated on potential CRS and neurologic symptoms, such 
as fever, dyspnea, confusion, aphasia, dysphasia, somnolence, encephalopathy, ataxia, or tremor.  
Subjects or their family members/caregivers should be instructed to immediately contact the 
treating investigator or seek immediate medical attention if any of these symptoms develop.  
Alternatively, subjects may be hospitalized to receive their axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion and 
be observed for CRS and neurologic toxicities in the hospital setting, if deemed appropriate by 
the investigator.   
If subjects are hospitalized, subjects should not be discharged from the hospital until all 
axicabtagene ciloleucel-related non-hematological toxicities resolve to ≤ Grade 1 or return to 
baseline.  Subjects may be discharged with non-critical and clinically stable or improving 
toxicities (e.g., renal insufficiency) even if > Grade 1, if deemed appropriate by the 
investigator.  Subjects should remain in a hospital for ongoing axicabtagene ciloleucel-related 
fever, hypotension, hypoxia, or ongoing neurologic toxicities > Grade 1, or if deemed necessary 
by the investigator.

Central venous access, such as a port or a peripherally inserted central catheter, is required for 
the administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel.  Catheter care, per institutional guidelines, should 
be followed.  Materials and instructions for the thawing, timing, and administering of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel are outlined in the Investigational Product Manual.  The Investigational 
Product Manual must be reviewed prior to administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel.   
Research sites should follow institutional guidelines for the infusion of cell products. 
6.3.3. 
Rationale for Study Treatment Dosing  
6.3.3.1. 
Rationale for Conditioning Chemotherapy Dose in Phase 1 Cohort A1 
Increasing levels of conditioning chemotherapy correlates with clinical responses to adoptive cell 
therapy (Dudley et al, 2008).  Specifically, there appears to be a link between adequate 
lymphodepletion and adoptively transferred T cell expansion and function in pre-clinical models.  
The depth and duration of the lymphodepletion in preclinical models correlate with anti-tumor 
activity of the adoptively transferred tumor-specific CD8+ T cells (Gattinoni et al, 2005).  
Lymphodepletion may function by eradicating cytokine sinks for the transferred cells, 
eliminating T regulatory cells, or enhancing antigen presenting cell activation (Klebanoff et al, 
2005).  Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine is a potent lymphodepleting regimen.  Optimizing the 
doses of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to improve the depth and duration of 
lymphodepletion may enhance the activity of axicabtagene ciloleucel.   
As described in the IB, the NCI study (09-C-0082; IND 13871) evaluated three groups of 
subjects based on conditioning regimens.  Group 3 evaluated cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2) 
and fludarabine (30 mg/m2), both given for 3 concurrent days followed by 1-2 x 106 anti-CD19 
CAR T cells.  Eleven subjects were treated with this regimen.   
The DLT definition in the KTE-C19-101 study was applied to the NCI study (09-C-0082; 
IND 13871) data in group 3.  There were no DLTs.  The subject incidences of Grade 3, 4, 5, and 
serious adverse events attributed to CAR+ T-cells were 3 (27%), 0 (0%), 0 (0%), and 1 (9%).  
The ORR in this cohort was 60%, including 10% complete responses.  Many subjects, however, 
did not achieve blood lymphocyte counts of zero with this conditioning regimen. 
To improve the depth and duration of lymphocyte depletion, the conditioning chemotherapy dose 
in Phase 1 Cohort A1 will be cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) and fludarabine (30 mg/m2) both 
given for 3 concurrent days with the target dose of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg.  This 
regimen is currently being evaluated in the NCI study (09-C-0082; IND 13871).

has been studied and tolerated in subjects with B cell malignancies (O'Brien et al, 2001). Similar 
total doses of cyclophosphamide (900 to 2,000 mg/m2) and fludarabine (90 to 150 mg/m2) have 
been given as a reduced non-myeloblative conditioning regimen in subjects with B cell 
malignancies receiving allogeneic stem cell ti·
ansplants (Khouri et al, 1998). The 
cyclophosphamide dose used in this regimen (Coho1
i Al and currently in the NCI study 
09-C-0082; IND 1387) is approximately 38% lower than that used in the Group 2 
cyclophosphamide 30 mg/kg conditioning regimen from the NCI study (incidence ofDLT 29%), 
with the same lower dose of fludarabine dose as Group 3. Evaluation of higher conditioning 
chemotherapy doses and/or va1ying anti-CD19 CART cell doses would proceed based on the 
incidence of 
DLT and evaluation of benefit-risk.

definition in the KTE-C19-101 study was applied to the NCI study data for subjects in group 2 
with B-cell lymphomas, dosed at ~ 2.5 x 106 anti-CD19 CART cells, and 
dose of cyclophosphamide to reflect the KTE-C 
19-101 protocol. Seven subjects met these DLT

Grade 3, 4, 5, and serious adverse events atti·ibuted to CART cells were 1 (14%), 2 (29%), 
0 (0%), and 2 (29%). The Grade 4 events were Grade 4 hypotension, Grade 4 somnolence, and 
Grade 4 aphasia/dysphasia (3 events in 2 subjects) (data on file, Kite Phanna). The subject 
incidence ORR in this coho1
i was 6 (86%), including 5 (71 
%) complete responses of 
which 4 are

The duration and depth of lymphodepletion appeared to be improved with this higher dose of 
cyclophosphamide conditioning chemotherapy (data on file, Kite Phanna). While the sample 
sizes are small, the data suggest that greater objective and complete response rates may be 
attained with a higher dose of conditioning chemotherapy regimen. Therefore, the regimen in 
Coho1

the incidence ofDLT in Coho1

evaluate the impact of conditioning chemotherapy on benefit/risk.

i 1 
and Coho1
i 2 
In the multicenter randomized Phase 3 CORAL study where subjects were randomized to R-ICE 
or R-DHAP second-line therapy followed by ASCT with or without rituximab maintenance, 
203 subjects across both anns did not proceed with ASCT. These subjects were ineligible for 
ASCT for multiple reasons including chemorefractory disease, early relapsed disease, residual 
masses after salvage therapy and intolerance to therapy. The median overall survival of 
these 
203 ASCT ineligible subjects after salvage chemotherapy was only 4.4 months (Van Den Neste 
et al, 2016). Therefore, the efficacy of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel will be estimated in this 
population which represents a significant unmet need for more effective therapies.

CRS and neurologic toxicities are two identified risks associated with axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
Both CRS and neurologic toxicities have led to Grade 4 or Grade 5 events in the context of 
anti-CD19 CART cells (Schuster et al, 2015; Turtle et al, 2016). The pathophysiology of 
CRS

is well described, but the etiology of the neurologic toxicities remains unclear.  Currently it is 
hypothesized that there are two potential mechanisms of the pathophysiology of neurologic 
toxicities:  1) peripheral systemic cytokine release followed by cytokine diffusion across the 
blood brain barrier (BBB) and/or 2) peripherally activated anti-CD19 CAR T cells translocate 
across the BBB and elicits a local inflammatory effect.  The later hypothesis is supported by 
emerging evidence of CAR T-cells trafficking to the CSF.  To further elucidate the 
pathophysiology of neurologic toxicities, serial CSF collections will be analyzed in this study for 
cytokines/chemokines/effector molecules and anti-CD19 CAR T cells. In addition, in an attempt 
to mitigate the onset and severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities, prophylactic tocilizumab and 
levetiracetam will be administered in Cohort 3 (see Section 6.3.4).  It is hypothesized that 
tocilizumab may lead to fewer activated CAR T-cells trafficking to the CNS and levetiracetam 
may reduce the risk of clinical or subclinical seizures.  Lastly, in an effort to mitigate the severity 
and/or duration of the neurologic toxicities, IT-Ara C with corticosteroids is recommended to be 
administered at the onset of Grade 3 neurologic toxicities (see Section 6.4.1). 
6.3.3.4.2. 
Cohort 4 and Cohort 6 
In the Phase 2 pivotal study portion of ZUMA-1 (n = 101), CAR T-cell levels were associated 
with response (P = 0.0002), with a 5.4-fold higher area under the curve (AUC) within the first 
28 days post-treatment for responders versus non-responders.  However, CAR T-cell levels and 
specific cytokines, including IL-2, GM-CSF, and ferritin, were only associated with Grade 3 or 
higher neurologic toxicity suggesting that distinct mechanisms may underlie the pathogenesis of 
these adverse events, as shown in Figure 4 and (Locke et al, 2017).  While there is a theoretical 
concern for the use of immunosuppressive agents to manage CRS or neurologic toxicities, 
tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids usage did not appear to affect negatively the overall response 
in ZUMA-1 and CAR T-cell levels (Table 6).  Prophylactic tocilizumab use in Cohort 3 appeared 
to lower the rate of Grade 3 or higher CRS but not neurologic toxicities (Table 7).  To further 
refine the use of corticosteroids to treat CRS and neurologic toxicities, Cohort 4 and Cohort 6 
will recommend corticosteroids at lower toxicity grades to determine the impact on incidence 
and severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities (Section 6.4.1).  Cohort 6 will further build on 
this rationale by initiating corticosteroids as prophylactic treatment on Day 0, Day 1, and 
Day 2. Prophylactic tocilizumab will not be used in Cohort 4, Cohort 5, or Cohort 6 
(Section 6.3.4).

Data cut for Phase 1, Phase 2 Cohort 1 and 2: Primary Analysis, DCO 27JAN2017. 
Data cut of SMS Cohort 3: Updated Analysis, DCO 11AUG2017. 
Neurologic events are graded per CTCAE 4.03; CRS events are graded per Lee grade (Lee et al, 2014).   
a. 
Neurologic AEs were identified with a search strategy based on known neurologic toxicities associated with anti-CD19 
immunotherapy (Topp et al, 2015). For Phase 1, Phase 2 Cohort 1 and 2, the neurologic toxicities included events with onset 
between date of first axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion (Day 0) and Day 56; for SMS Cohort 3, the neurologic toxicities 
included events with onset on or after the date of first conditioning chemotherapy. 
b. 
One subject in Phase 1 had CRS symptoms reported but not graded for CRS at the time at the Primary Analysis data cut. 
This subject was counted in the “Any CRS” row but not by the worst grade. 
6.3.3.4.3. 
Cohort 5 
In the pivotal cohorts of ZUMA-1, Phase 2 (Cohorts 1 and 2; n = 101), subjects with relapsed 
and refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma were not permitted to receive anti-cancer therapy 
between leukapheresis and conditioning chemotherapy. However, a subsequent retrospective 
analysis suggested a relationship between lymphoma burden (estimated by the sum of the 
product of diameters [SPD] of index lesions) and clinical outcomes (Locke et al, 2018). Subjects 
with the lowest SPD had the highest rates of ongoing response at 1 year and the lowest rates of 
CRS and neurological events.  Thus, Cohort 5 will be used to prospectively assess the impact of 
debulking therapy, administered after leukapheresis but prior to conditioning chemotherapy, on

the safety and efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel.  The goal of the debulking therapy will be to 
reduce lymphoma burden and assess clinical outcomes.  
Furthermore, the majority (90%) of patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) DLBCL who were 
included in another CAR T-cell therapy study (KYMRIAH™ and Novartis Pharmaceuticals 
Corporation 2018) received the investigator’s choice of bridging therapy that may have had a 
debulking effect. Although debulking was not explicitly tested, 8 of these patients had no 
measurable disease following bridging therapy. The overall results from this study suggested that 
the inclusion of the investigator’s choice of bridging therapy was well-tolerated, as no new safety 
signals were identified using this approach. Toxicities observed within the JULIET study were 
consistent with other CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapies. 
In conclusion, the goal of Cohort 5 is to improve the benefit-risk ratio of axicabtagene ciloleucel 
by reducing lymphoma burden prior to administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel.  This approach 
is justified by a retrospective analysis of outcome by tumor burden in ZUMA-1 and data from 
other CD19-targeting CAR T-cell products.  The specific safety regimens studied in Cohorts 3 
and 4 will not be continued in Cohort 5.

of the study is provided in Section 7.  Refer to the CRF completion guidelines for data collection 
requirements and documentation of study procedures. 
7.1. 
Informed Consent 
Before a subject’s participation in the clinical study, the investigator is responsible for obtaining 
written informed consent from the subject after adequate explanation of the study design, 
anticipated benefits and the potential risks.  Subjects should sign the most current IRB/IEC 
approved ICF prior to any study specific activity or procedure is performed. 
The consent process and the subject’s agreement or refusal to participate in the study is to be 
documented in the subject’s medical records.  If the subject agrees to participate, the ICF is to be 
signed and personally dated by the subject and by the person who conducted the informed 
consent discussion.  The original signed ICF will be retained in accordance with institution 
policy and IRB/IEC requirements with a copy of the ICF provided to the subject. 
All subjects who are enrolled into the study should be re-consented with any updated version of 
the IRB/IEC approved ICF if relevant to their participation in the study. 
7.2. 
Demographic Data 
Demographic data will be collected to include sex, age, race, ethnicity, and country of enrollment 
to study their possible association with subject safety and treatment effectiveness. 
7.3. 
Medical and Treatment History 
Relevant medical history prior to the start of adverse event reporting will be collected.  Relevant 
medical history is defined as data on the subject’s concurrent medical condition that would be 
typically shared in a referral letter.  All findings will be recorded in the CRFs. 
In addition to the medical history, all history related to the subject’s disease, treatment and 
response to treatment will be collected and must date back to the original diagnosis. 
For subjects who are being referred from another clinic or institution to the participating research 
center, copies from the subjects chart should be obtained. 
7.4. 
Physical Exam, Vital Signs, Performance Status, and EQ-5D 
Physical exams will be performed during screening and at times noted in the SOA.  Changes 
noted in subsequent exams when compared to the baseline exam will be reported as an adverse 
event.

During IP administration, vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and 
temperature will be monitored before and after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion and then 
routinely per institutional guidelines.  If the subject has a fever (temperature 38.3oC or greater), 
vital signs will be monitored more frequently as clinically indicated. 
Performance status as measured by the ECOG scale will be performed to quantify the subject’s 
general well-being and ability to perform activities of daily life. 
For subjects enrolled in Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5 or, Cohort 6, EQ-5D will be completed 
by the subject, prior to any other assessment, at the screening visit and at other times noted in the 
SOA.  Subjects who are blind or illiterate may have the EQ-5D questions read to them by the 
study staff.  The study staff, however, cannot interpret any of the questions for the subject.  A 
subject may be exempt from completing the questionnaire if he or she is unable to read the 
questionnaire in one of the country languages available.  
The EQ-5D is a 2 page generic patient questionnaire for assessing the overall health status of a 
subject.  The EQ-5D consists of a 5 dimension descriptive system including questions on 
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/comfort, and anxiety/depression and a visual analogue 
scale (EQ VAS) which allows the respondent to record health on a vertical scale (eg, best health 
to worst health) thus allowing a quantitative measure of health outcome.   
7.5. 
Neurological Assessment  
For subjects enrolled in Cohort 1, Cohort 2, or Cohort 3, neurological assessments will be 
standardized by using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) standard version 2.0.  The 
MMSE neurological assessment will not be required for Phase 2 SMS Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and 
Cohort 6.  The MMSE is a 5-10 minute, 11-question measure that examines various areas of 
cognitive function: orientation, attention, immediate recall, short-term recall, language, and the 
ability to follow simple verbal and written commands. 
The MMSE is divided into two sections.  The first part requires vocal responses to the examiner's 
questions.  In the second part of the exam, the subject is asked to follow verbal and written 
instructions, write a sentence spontaneously, and copy a geometric figure.  Every attempt should 
be made to dedicate a single research staff member trained in the administration of the MMSE to 
conduct the assessment to minimize variability among different assessors. 
A full neurological assessment will be completed during screening to establish a baseline.  
Subsequent assessments will be performed before axicabtagene ciloleucel administration on 
Day 0, on Day 1, and then every other day during the 7-day post-infusion monitoring period, as 
well as at the Week 4 and Month 3 visits.

7.6. 
Cardiac Function  
Each subject’s cardiac function, as measured by ECHO will be assessed during the screening 
period to confirm study eligibility.  Both left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and pericardial 
effusion will be assessed prior to study entrance by ECHO.  An ECHO performed following the 
subject’s last chemotherapy treatment and within 28 days prior to signing the consent may be 
used for confirmation of eligibility.  
To establish a baseline, an ECG will also be performed during the screening period.  
7.7. 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
Each subject will undergo a screening brain MRI, with contrast whenever possible or without 
contrast in case of contraindication, to rule out CNS metastasis during the screening period of the 
study.  An MRI performed following the subject’s last chemotherapy treatment and ≤ 28 days 
before signing the consent may be used for confirmation of eligibility.  
Evaluation of any new onset of ≥ Grade 2 neurologic toxicities should include a brain MRI as 
described in Section 6.4.  
7.8. 
Bone Marrow Biopsy 
Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy will be performed at screening if not previously performed to 
assess bone marrow involvement.  For subjects with a potential complete response to 
axicabtagene ciloleucel, a follow-up bone marrow aspirate/biopsy will be performed in subjects 
presenting with bone marrow involvement prior to therapy or if new abnormalities in the 
peripheral blood counts or blood smear cause clinical suspicion of bone marrow involvement 
with lymphoma after treatment.  To confirm a complete response, the bone marrow aspirate and 
biopsy must show no evidence of disease by morphology or if indeterminate by morphology it 
must be negative by immunohistochemistry.  Refer to Section 7.10 and Appendix Afor treatment 
response assessment requirements per the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant 
Lymphoma (Cheson et al, 2007).  Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy should also be considered to 
evaluate hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) as indicated in the IB.  A portion of the 
bone marrow sample collected to evaluate HLH or other toxicities should be submitted to the 
central laboratory as outlined in the central laboratory manual.  
7.9. 
Lumbar Puncture 
Subjects with symptoms of central nervous system malignancy such as new onset severe 
headaches, neck stiffness, or any focal neurologic findings on physical exam will have lumbar 
puncture performed at the screening visit for examination of cerebral spinal fluid.  In addition, 
lumbar puncture may be performed as applicable for subjects with new onset of ≥ Grade 2 
neurologic toxicities after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion (see Section 6.4).

Phase 2 Safety Management Study 
For subjects enrolled in Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, or Cohort 6, lumbar punctures for the 
collection of CSF samples will be performed pre- and post-axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion at 
times outlined in the SOA.  Samples will be submitted to the central laboratory as outlined in the 
central laboratory manual.  Adequate platelet support should be provided prior to performing a 
lumbar puncture (e.g. platelet >50,000/mm3). 
7.10. 
Disease Response Assessment  
Subjects will be evaluated for disease response by the site investigator at times indicated in the 
SOA.  Disease assessments will be evaluated per the revised IWG Response Criteria for 
Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al, 2007).  Flow cytometric, molecular or cytogenetic studies 
will not be used to determine response. 
Baseline positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scans of the neck, 
chest, abdomen and pelvis, along with the appropriate imaging of all other sites of disease are 
required.  Subjects will undergo additional PET-CT tumor assessments after their axicabtagene 
ciloleucel infusion.  The first of these post-treatment PET-CT tumor assessments will occur 4 
weeks after infusion; subsequent assessments will occur at regular intervals throughout the post-
treatment and long-term follow-up portions of the study, as highlighted in the SOA. 
After axicabtagene ciloleucel administration, disease assessments will be used to determine the 
time when progressive disease occurs.  Subjects with symptoms suggestive of disease 
progression should be evaluated for progression at the time symptoms occur even if it is off 
schedule as per the SOA.  
A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will be performed in subjects who are being assessed for CR.  
Per the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al, 2007), a bone 
marrow aspirate and biopsy should be performed only when the subject had bone marrow 
involvement with lymphoma prior to therapy or if new abnormalities in the peripheral blood 
counts or blood smear cause clinical suspicion of bone marrow involvement with lymphoma 
after treatment.  The bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must show no evidence of disease by 
morphology, or if indeterminate by morphology, it must be negative by immunohistochemistry 
to assign a CR to treatment.   
In addition to the investigator’s assessment, PET-CT scans of all subjects evaluated for disease 
response for Phase 2 pivotal study (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) will be submitted to and reviewed by 
an independent central reviewer.  For subjects who discontinue the study due to an assessment of 
progressive disease which was not subsequently confirmed by a central radiology reviewer, any 
additional imaging data, subsequent to the image in question will be submitted to the central 
reviewer to confirm disease response.  
If the subject is eligible for retreatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel, the last scan prior to 
retreatment will be considered the baseline for the purpose of evaluating the response to 
retreatment.

7.11. 
Laboratory 
The below samples will be collected at the time points indicated in the SOA.  Additional samples 
(eg, blood, urine, CSF, tissue, etc) may be collected as needed for further safety testing. 
Local lab analysis:   
 Sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), total CO2 (bicarbonate), creatinine, glucose, 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or urea (if BUN test cannot be analyzed by the local lab), 
albumin, calcium total, magnesium total (Mg), inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, 
ALT/glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT), AST/glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), 
total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid 
 C-reactive protein (CRP)  
 Complete blood count (CBC) with differential  
 A urine or serum sample will be collected and assessed locally for females of childbearing 
potential.  If the screening pregnancy test is positive, the subjects should not be enrolled.  If a 
standard of care pregnancy test is collected during the course of the study, and the result is 
positive, the investigator should contact the Kite Pharma medical monitor for instructions.  If 
a female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during the conduct of the study, it must 
be reported by contacting Kite Pharma Medical Monitor for instructions.  
 For EU sites, a serology (eg, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis) test will be carried out 
per institutional guidelines and EU regulations.  This may be administered within the 30 days 
prior to leukapheresis and/or on the day of leukapheresis. 
Central lab analysis: 
 Blood draws for PBMC (lymphocyte subsets, replication-competent retrovirus [RCR], and 
anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels) and cytokine analysis will be performed at intervals outlined 
in the SOA.   
 Serum samples will also be evaluated centrally for anti-axicabtagene ciloleucel antibodies. 
 For serum samples that demonstrate increased anti-axicabtagene ciloleucel antibodies at the 
Month 3 visit over baseline values, attempts should be made to obtain and test additional 
serum samples approximately every 3 months until the antibody levels return to baseline (or 
becomes negative) or up to 1 year from the completion of treatment, whichever occurs first. 
 Archived tumor tissue

 For subjects enrolled in Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6, a block or 30 unstained slides 
should be submitted to the central laboratory for confirmatory diagnosis, CD19 expression, 
cell of origin, and determination of double/triple hit high grade lymphoma.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 CSF and possibly bone marrow samples will also be collected and analyzed at the central 
laboratory as outlined in the schedule of assessments and per Section 7.12. 
 See central laboratory manual for details on sample collection, processing, and shipping 
instructions.  
7.12. 
Biomarkers 
Biomarker analysis will be performed on blood and tumor samples to evaluate pharmacodynamic 
markers for axicabtagene ciloleucel.  Prognostic markers specific for large B-cell lymphoma and 
related to the tumor immune environment may also be evaluated in archived and fresh tumor 
biopsies.  
The presence, expansion, persistence, and immunophenotype of transduced anti-CD19 
CAR T cells will be monitored in the blood primarily by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
analysis, complemented by flow cytometry.  Expansion and persistence in peripheral blood will 
also be monitored by a CD19 CAR specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) 
assay.   
Levels of serum cytokines will be evaluated in serum to characterize the pharmacodynamic and 
safety profile of axicabtagene ciloleucel.  The following pro-inflammatory, homeostatic and 
immune modulating cytokines may be included in the panel:  IL-6, IL-15, IL-17a, TNF-, 
GM-CSF, IFN-, IL-12p40/p70 and IL-13; immune effector molecules: Granzyme A, B and 
Perforin; correlates of acute phase response: CRP and SAA; Chemokines MIP-1, MIP-1β, 
MCP-1, IP-10, and IL-8.  In addition, IL1Ra, IL2Rα, and ferritin will also be measured. 
CSF, as well as additional samples (eg, pleural fluid), may be harvested from subjects who 
develop neurologic toxicities or CRS to enable evaluation of inflammatory cytokines and 
chemokine levels.  As applicable, lymphocyte populations residing in the CSF, or other subject 
samples, may also be monitored for the purpose of understanding the safety profile of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel.

Phase 2 Safety Management Study 
For subjects enrolled in Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, or Cohort 6, lumbar punctures for 
collection of CSF samples will be performed at the following time points:  after eligibility is 
confirmed and prior to start of conditioning chemotherapy, after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion 
on Day 5 (± 3 days), and at the Week 4 visit (± 3 days).  Collection of CSF samples will enable 
measurement of baseline cytokine levels prior to axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  Changes in 
levels of cytokines after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion will be measured at the time of peak 
CAR T-cell expansion (Day 5) and at Week 4 when it is anticipated that cytokine levels would 
return to baseline levels.  Infiltration of CAR T cells will also be assessed by flow cytometry in 
post-axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion CSF samples.  
 
 
 
For subjects enrolled in Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6, additional blood will be collected on 
Day 1 (Cohort 6 only), Day 2 (Cohort 6 only), Day 3, Day 7, Day 10, and Week 3 after 
axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  The intent of the additional blood samples is to enable early 
monitoring of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell and serum cytokine levels in the blood of subjects treated 
more aggressively with tocilizumab and corticosteroids.  To balance the total amount of blood 
drawn over the first 3 months of therapy, blood volumes have been reduced at pre-specified time 
points (refer to the central laboratory manual for details). 
Phase 2 Pivotal Study and Safety Management Study 
Bone marrow samples may be collected for subjects who develop toxicities after axicabtagene 
ciloleucel infusion and will be analyzed centrally by immunohistochemistry for evidence of 
disease, treatment emergent toxicities (e.g. HLH, pancytopenia) and presence of anti-CD19 CAR 
T cells.  
Because axicabtagene ciloleucel comprises retroviral vector transduced T cells, the presence of 
RCR in the blood of treated subjects will be monitored.

7.13. 
Description of Study Periods 
Investigative sites will maintain a log of all screened subjects who were reviewed and evaluated 
for study participation.  Information collected on the screening log should include limited 
information such as the date of screening, date the subject was enrolled or the reason for why the 
subject failed screening. 
7.13.1. 
Screening 
The screening period begins on the date the subject signs the IRB/IEC approved ICF and 
continues through confirmation of enrollment.  Informed consent must be obtained before 
completion of any non-standard of care study specific procedures.  Procedures that are part of 
standard of care are not considered study specific procedures and may be performed prior to 
obtaining consent and used to confirm eligibility.  Confirmation of this data must occur within 
the time allowance as outlined below and in the SOA. 
After written informed consent has been obtained, subjects will be screened to confirm study 
eligibility and participation.  Only subjects who meet the eligibility criteria listed in Section 5 
and who commence leukapheresis will be enrolled in the study.  If at any time prior to 
enrollment the subject fails to meet the eligibility criteria, the subject should be designated as a 
screen failure on the subject screening log with the reasons for failing screening. 
The following assessments/procedures are to be completed during the screening period at the 
time points outlined in the SOA: 
 Medical history and disease assessment 
 Physical examination including height and weight

may be used for confirmation of eligibility.  
 If PET CT is performed > 28 days prior to the initiation of conditioning chemotherapy or if 
subject receives any anti-cancer therapy between screening and conditioning chemotherapy, 
the scans must be repeated to establish a new baseline. For subjects in Cohort 5, if no 
conditioning chemotherapy is being administered, a PET-CT must be repeated to establish a 
new baseline prior to the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. PET-CT should be performed as 
close to enrollment as possible.   
 Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy as needed (if not done at initial diagnosis or between diagnosis 
and screening) 
 Labs  
 Chemistry panel

conditioning chemotherapy 
7.13.2. 
Rescreening 
Subjects who are unable to complete or meet the eligibility criteria during the 28-day screening 
period will be permitted to rescreen one time.  Subjects will retain the same subject identification 
number assigned at the original screening.  If rescreening occurs within 28 days of the signing of 
the original informed consent, only the procedure(s)/assessment(s) that did not originally meet 
the eligibility criteria needs to be repeated; all other initial screening procedures/assessments do 
not need to be repeated.  If rescreening occurs, or leukapheresis is delayed, more than 28 days 
from the signing of the original informed consent, subjects must be reconsented and repeat all 
screening procedures/assessments. 
7.13.3. 
Enrollment/Leukapheresis 
If any screening assessments or procedures are repeated between confirmation of eligibility and 
the start of leukapheresis and results are outside the eligibility criteria listed in Section 5, contact 
the Kite medical monitor prior to proceeding with leukapheresis. 
Before leukapheresis commences, the following criteria must be met.  If criteria are not met, 
leukapheresis must be delayed until the event resolves.   If leukapheresis is delayed beyond 
5 days, baseline CBC with differential and chemistry panel must be repeated.  If results are 
outside eligibility criteria listed in Section 5, contact the Kite medical monitor prior to 
proceeding with leukapheresis. 
 No evidence or suspicion of an infection 
 Corticosteroid therapy at a pharmacologic dose

7.13.6. 
Conditioning Chemotherapy Period  
If any screening assessments or procedures are repeated between screening and the start of 
conditioning chemotherapy and results are outside the eligibility criteria (Section 5), contact the 
Kite medical monitor for approval prior to proceeding with conditioning chemotherapy. 
If PET-CT will be older than 28 days at the initiation of conditioning chemotherapy or if the 
subject receives any anti-cancer therapy with therapeutic intent (eg, radiation, supraphysiologic 
doses of steroids, chemotherapy) between the last PET-CT and initiation of conditioning 
chemotherapy, the PET-CT must be repeated to establish a new baseline. 
Subjects in Cohort 5 and Cohort 6 may proceed with conditioning chemotherapy in absence of 
measurable disease in the new baseline PET-CT if they have received preceding bridging or 
debulking therapy (Cohort 5).  
The investigational product (axicabtagene ciloleucel) must be available before initiation of 
conditioning chemotherapy. 
7.13.6.1. 
Requirements for Initiating Conditioning Chemotherapy 
Administration of anti-CD19 CAR T cells to subjects with ongoing infection or inflammation, 
even if such processes are asymptomatic, increases the risk of high grade and fatal toxicity. All 
efforts should be made to rule out such conditions prior to cell infusion. Signs, symptoms or 
abnormal laboratory results attributed to the malignancy (eg “tumor fever,” elevated CRP) are 
diagnoses of exclusion that require a documented workup to establish. Conditioning 
chemotherapy and axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion should only be initiated after it is reasonably 
assured that cell infusion can safely proceed.  
If any of the following criteria are met prior to initiation of conditioning chemotherapy, then the 
work-up listed in Section 7.13.7.3 must be performed to determine the potential cause if there is 
no identified source of infection. 
 Temperature > 38°Celsius within 72 hours of conditioning chemotherapy  
 CRP > 100 mg/L anytime between enrollment to start of conditioning chemotherapy 
 WBC count or WBC differential that is suggestive of infectious process, and is observed 
between enrollment and the initiation of conditioning chemotherapy (eg WBC > 20,000/µL, 
rapidly increasing WBC, or differential with high percentage of segments/bands) 
Additionally: 
 If any screening assessments or procedures are repeated between confirmation of eligibility 
and the start of conditioning chemotherapy and results are outside the eligibility criteria listed 
in Section 5, then the condition must resolve prior to proceeding with conditioning 
chemotherapy.

 Complete history and physical exam including head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat (HEENT) 
exam, cardiac, vascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, integumentary, and neurological 
systems must not reveal evidence of infection/inflammation. 
 The subject must not have received systemic antimicrobials for the treatment of known or 
suspected infection within 48 hours before conditioning chemotherapy (prophylactic use of 
antimicrobials is allowed). 
 Treatment course of any antimicrobials given for known or suspected antecedent infection 
should be complete as per infectious disease consult (if applicable) recommendation before 
stopping or switching to prophylactic antimicrobials. 
 If the subject is confirmed to have an infectious process for which antimicrobials are not 
available (eg, viral pneumonia), the infection must be clinically resolved as determined by 
the investigator and in consultation with infectious disease service (if applicable). 
 The most recently collected blood, urine, or other body fluid cultures must show no growth 
for at least 48 hours, and any other infectious workup performed (eg, bacterial, viral 
serologies, PCR, stood studies, imaging studies) must be negative. If clinical suspicion is for 
an infection for which cultures are unlikely to be positive within 48 hours (eg, fungal 
infection), adequate time must be allowed for cultures to become positive. 
Once the above criteria are met, then the subject can proceed with conditioning chemotherapy.

Requirements for Initiating Axicabtagene Ciloleucel Infusion 
If any of the following criteria are met prior to the initiation of axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, 
then the work-up listed in Section 7.13.7.3 must be performed to determine the potential cause if 
there is no identified source of infection.   
 Temperature > 38°Celsius within 72 hours of axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. 
 CRP > 100 mg/L anytime between enrollment to start of conditioning chemotherapy  
 WBC count or WBC differential, that is suggestive of infectious process, and is observed 
between enrollment and the initiation of axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion (eg, WBC 
> 20,000/µL, rapidly increasing WBC, or differential with high percentage or 
segments/bands) 
 Additionally: If any screening assessments or procedures are repeated between confirmation 
of eligibility and the start of axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion and results are outside the 
eligibility criteria listed in Section 5, then the condition must resolve prior to proceeding with 
axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion (except for peripheral blood cell counts that have been 
impacted by conditioning chemotherapy)  
 Complete history and physical exam including HEENT exam, cardiac, vascular, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, integumentary, and neurological systems must not reveal evidence of 
infection/inflammation.  
 The subject must not have received systemic antimicrobials for the treatment of a known or 
suspected infection within 48 hours before axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion (prophylactic use 
of antimicrobials is allowed)  
 Treatment course of any antimicrobials given for known or suspected antecedent infection 
should be complete as per infectious disease consult (if applicable) recommendation before 
stopping or switching to prophylactic antimicrobials  
 If a subject is confirmed to have an infectious process for which antimicrobials are not 
available (eg, viral pneumonia), the infection must be clinically resolved as determined by 
the investigator in consultation with infectious disease service (if applicable).  
 Most recently collected blood, urine, or other body fluid cultures must show no growth for at 
least 48 hours, and any other infectious workup performed (eg, bacterial, viral serologies, 
PCR, stool studies, imaging studies) must be negative. If clinical suspicion is for an infection 
for which cultures are unlikely to be positive within 48 hours (eg, fungal infection), adequate 
time must be allowed for cultures to become positive. 
After the above criteria are met, then the subject can proceed with administration of axicabtagene 
ciloleucel. For Cohort 6 only, dexamethasone 
 should be given prior to 
axicabtagene ciloleuclel infusion (refer to Section 7.13.7.2).

If the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion is delayed > 2 weeks from the planned infusion date, 
protocol guidelines should be followed regarding the need for repeat conditioning chemotherapy.  
7.13.7.2. 
Monitoring After Axicabtagene Ciloleucel Infusion 
All subjects will receive axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion at a healthcare facility followed by 
daily monitoring at a healthcare facility for at least 7 days unless otherwise required by country 
regulatory agencies (refer to Appendix B) to monitor for signs and symptoms of CRS and 
neurologic toxicities.  Alternatively, subjects may be hospitalized to receive their axicabtagene 
ciloleucel infusion and be observed for CRS and neurologic toxicities in the hospital setting, if 
deemed appropriate by the investigator.  
If subjects are hospitalized, subjects should not be discharged from the hospital until all 
axicabtagene ciloleucel related non-hematological toxicities return to ≤ Grade 1 or return to 
baseline.  Subjects may be discharged with non-critical and clinically stable or improving 
toxicities (eg, renal insufficiency) even if > Grade 1, if deemed appropriate by the investigator.  
Subjects should remain in a hospital for ongoing axicabtagene ciloleucel-related fever, 
hypotension, hypoxia, or ongoing central neurologic toxicities > Grade 1, or if deemed necessary 
by the investigator. 
Subjects should be instructed to remain within proximity of the clinical study site for at least 
4 weeks following axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  Subjects and their family 
members/caregivers should be educated on potential CRS and neurologic symptoms, such as 
fever, dyspnea, confusion, aphasia, dysphagia, somnolence, encephalopathy, ataxia, or tremor.  
Subjects or their family members/caregivers should be instructed to immediately contact the 
treating investigator or seek immediate medical attention if any of these symptoms develop. 
During this period, the following procedures will be completed at the time points outlined in the 
SOA: 
 Neurological assessment including MMSE for subjects enrolled in Cohort 1, Cohort 2, or 
Cohort 3   
 MMSE will be administered before treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel on Day 0, and 
then on Day 1 and every other day during the 7-day post-infusion monitoring period. 
 Vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature, daily at a 
health care facility for at least 7 days  
 Labs (before axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, as described in the SOA) 
 Chemistry Panel  
 CBC with differential 
 Lymphocyte subsets  
 Cytokine levels

 Anti-CD19 CAR T cells 
 RCR analysis 
 Cohort 6 only: Dexamethasone 
 
 
 Infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel 
 For subjects enrolled in Cohort 3, administer tocilizumab at a dose of 
 IV over 
1 hour (not to exceed 800 mg) on Day 2. See Section 6.3.4 for further details on additional 
tocilizumab administration for toxicity management. 
 For subjects enrolled in Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6, administer 
levetiracetam at a dose of 750 mg (PO or IV) BID starting on Day 0.  See Section 6.4 for 
further details on administration and discontinuation of levetiracetam for toxicity 
management.  If subject does not experience any neurologic toxicities ≥ Grade 2, taper and 
discontinue levetiracetam as clinically indicated. 
 For subjects assigned to Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6, lumbar puncture for 
collection of CSF samples at Day 5 (± 3 days) 
 Subjects in Cohort 5 and Cohort 6 may proceed with axicabtagene ciloleucel if the new 
baseline PET-CT shows an absence of measurable disease.  
 As applicable, lumbar puncture, for subjects with new onset Grade ≥ 2 neurologic symptoms 
after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion 
 
 should be completed for examination of CSF.  
 
 
 
 
 Concomitant medications documentation 
Monitoring of CRP, ferritin, and LDH (only if LDH is elevated at baseline) levels may assist 
with the diagnosis and define the clinical course in regards to CRS/neurologic toxicities.  It is, 
therefore, recommended that CRP, ferritin, and LDH (if elevated at baseline) be monitored daily 
starting at Day 0 and for at least 7 days at a healthcare facility. In addition, lactate should be 
monitored as clinically indicated. 
7.13.7.3. 
Requirements for Work-up Potential Infectious and/or Inflammatory States 
In the absence of an identified source of infection (eg, line infection, pneumonia on chest x-ray), 
the minimum workup to be performed prior to administration of conditioning chemotherapy 
and/or axicabtagene ciloleucel consists of the following:  
 Call Kite medical monitor 
 Infectious disease service consult (if available)

 CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with IV contrast. If there is a medical 
contraindication to contrast, then non-contrast CT is allowed. 
 The following must be performed (prior to the initiation of antimicrobials if clinically 
feasible): 
 Blood cultures (aerobic and anaerobic x 2 bottles each) and urinalysis and urine culture. 
Deep/induced sputum culture if clinically indicated. 
  All indwelling lines, such as central venous catheters, should be examined for any signs 
of infection and additional cultures should be drawn from the line 
 Nasopharyngeal-throat swab or equivalent assay for viral infection such as influenza A/B 
(including H1N1), parainfluenza 1/2/3, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, 
coronavirus, metapneumovirus 
 Collection of fungal cultures and markers as appropriate (eg, galactomannan, fungitell)  
 Collection of appropriate serum viral studies (eg, cytomegalovirus [CMV])  
 If a central nervous system process is suspected, appropriate brain imaging and subsequent 
lumbar puncture with cytology, culture, Gram stain, and viral PCR should be performed. 
 Any additional sign or symptom-directed investigation should be performed as clinically 
indicated. 
Prior to proceeding with conditioning chemotherapy and/or axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, the 
above workup must not suggest the presence of an active infection and all requirements for 
conditioning chemotherapy and/or axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion must be satisfied. If the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion is delayed > 2 weeks following conditioning chemotherapy, 
protocol guidelines should be followed regarding the need for repeat conditioning chemotherapy. 
If the above workup was triggered due to CRP > 100 mg/L, CRP should be repeated. If CRP 
continues to increase significantly, an evaluation should be performed for any other potential 
infectious or inflammatory condition that was not previously evaluated. 
7.13.8. 
Post-treatment Assessment Period 
After completing axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion and completing the minimum 7-day 
observation period, all subjects will be followed in the post-treatment assessment period.  
Counting from Day 0 (axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion), subjects will return to the clinic at the 
following intervals.

SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL 
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without 
prejudice to their future medical care by the physician or at the institution. 
Subjects can decline to continue to receive study required treatment and/or other protocol 
required procedures at any time during the study but continue to participate in the study.  
This is referred to as partial withdrawal of consent. 
If partial withdrawal of consent occurs, the investigator must discuss with the subject the 
appropriate process for discontinuation from investigational product, study treatment or other 
protocol required therapies and must discuss options for continued participation, completion 
of procedures and the associated data collection as outlined in the SOA. The level of follow-
up and method of communication should also be discussed between the research staff and the 
subject and documented in the source documents. 
Withdrawal of full consent from a study means that the subject does not wish to receive 
further protocol required therapy or undergo procedures and the subject does not wish to 
continue further study follow-up.  Subject data collected up to withdrawal of consent will be 
retained and included in the analysis of the study, and where permitted by local regulations, 
publically available data (death records) can be included after withdrawal of consent.  The 
investigator is to discuss with the subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the 
study.  
As part of the study sites may be asked to conduct searches of public records, such as those 
establishing survival status, if available, to obtain survival data for any subject for whom the 
survival status is not known. Sites may be also asked to also retrieve autopsy reports to 
confirm status of disease at the time of death.  
The investigator and/or sponsor can also decide to withdraw a subject from the 
investigational product and/or other protocol-required therapies, protocol procedures, or the 
study as a whole or at any time prior to study completion. 
8.1. 
Reasons for Removal from Treatment 
Reasons for removal from protocol required investigational products or procedures include 
any of the following: 
 Adverse Event 
 Subject request 
 Product not available 
 Lost to Follow-up 
 Death 
 Decision by sponsor

SAFETY REPORTING 
9.1. 
Adverse Events 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject.  
The event does not necessarily have a relationship with study treatment.  The investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by 
the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record.  
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre-existing medical condition has increased in severity, 
frequency, and/or duration or has an association with a worse outcome.  A pre-existing 
condition that has not worsened during the study or involves an intervention such as elective 
cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study, is not considered an adverse event. 
Interventions for pretreatment conditions (such as elective cosmetic surgery) or medical 
procedures that were planned before study participation are not considered adverse events.  
Hospitalization for study treatment infusions or precautionary measures per institutional 
policy are not considered adverse events. 
The term “disease progression” as assessed by measurement of malignant lesions on 
radiographs or other methods should not be reported as adverse events.  Death due to disease 
progression in the absence of signs and symptoms should be reported as the primary tumor 
type (e.g., B-Cell Lymphoma).  
For situations when an adverse event or serious adverse event is due to the disease under 
investigation report the signs and symptoms.  Worsening of signs and symptoms of the 
malignancy under study should also be reported as adverse events in the appropriate section 
of the CRF.  
The investigators clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be removed 
from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject requests to withdraw from 
protocol required therapies or the study due to an adverse event, the subject should undergo 
the procedures outlined in the Month 3 visit of the SOA.  
9.2. 
Reporting of Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for reporting all adverse events observed by the investigator 
or reported by the subject that occur from enrollment (ie, commencement of leukapheresis) 
through 3 months after treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion or until the initiation 
of another anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first.   After 3 months, targeted adverse 
events including (eg, neurological, hematological, infections, autoimmune disorders, and 
secondary malignancies) will be monitored and reported for 24 months after treatment with 
axicabtagene ciloleucel or until disease progression, whichever occurs first.

CONFIDENTIAL 
Page 87 of 118 
 
11 February 2019 
 
For subjects who are enrolled, but do not receive axicabtagene ciloleucel, the adverse event 
reporting period ends 30 days after the last study-specific procedure (eg, leukapheresis, 
conditioning chemotherapy).  
The investigator must address the below for adverse events:  
 Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome (if not known, signs or symptoms) 
 Dates of onset and resolution 
 Severity 
 Assessment of relatedness to investigational product, conditioning chemotherapy or study 
procedures 
 Action taken 
Adverse event grading scale used will be the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. A copy of the grading scale can be downloaded from 
the CTEP home page (http://ctep.cancer.gov). Cytokine Release Syndrome events will also 
be reported using the grading scale outlined in Section 6.4.  
In reviewing adverse events, investigators must assess whether the adverse event is possibly 
related to 1) the investigational product (axicabtagene ciloleucel), 2) conditioning 
chemotherapy, or 3) any protocol-required study procedure.  The relationship is indicated by 
a yes or no response and entered into the CRF.  A yes response should indicate that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study treatment or procedure and the 
adverse event.  Additional relevant data with respect to describing the adverse event will be 
collected in the CRFs. 
The investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
resolution.  If a subject begins a new anticancer therapy, the adverse event reporting period 
for non-serious adverse events ends at the time the new treatment is started. 
9.2.1. 
Reporting Abnormal Laboratory Findings 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether 
an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change 
from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical 
significance (based on the investigator’s judgment) are not to be recorded as AEs.  However, 
abnormal laboratory findings that result in new or worsening clinical sequelae, or that require 
therapy or adjustment in current therapy, are considered AEs.  Where applicable, clinical 
sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the AE.

An abnormal laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it is a change from 
baseline and meets any of the following criteria: 
 Associated with clinical symptoms 
 Results in a medical intervention (eg, potassium supplementation for hypokalemia or iron 
replacement therapy for anemia) or a change in concomitant therapy 
 Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
9.3. 
Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the following 
serious criteria: 
 Fatal 
 Life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) 
 Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Other medically important serious event 
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization” if the event 
necessitated an admission to a healthcare facility (eg, overnight stay).  
Events that require an escalation of care when the subject is already hospitalized should be 
recorded as a serious adverse event. Examples of such events include movement from routine 
care in the hospital to the intensive care unit (ICU) or if that event resulted in a prolongation 
of the existing planned hospitalization.  
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any of the 
serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event with the criterion of 
“other medically important serious event.”  
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of an 
adverse event according to NCI CTCAE criteria; the event itself may be of relatively minor 
medical significance and, therefore, may not meet the seriousness criteria.  Severity and 
seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event recorded on the 
electronic CRF.

9.4. 
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for reporting all serious adverse events observed by the 
investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the consent through 3 
months after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion or until the initiation of another anti-
cancer therapy, whichever occurs first.  After 3 months, only serious targeted adverse 
events (e.g., neurological, hematological, infections, autoimmune disorders, and secondary 
malignancies) observed by the investigator or reported by the subject will be reported for 
24 months after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion or until disease progression, whichever 
occurs first.   For subjects who screen fail or are enrolled but do not receive axicabtagene 
ciloleucel, the reporting period for serious adverse events ends 30 days after the last 
procedure (e.g., screen procedure, leukapheresis, conditioning chemotherapy).   
Serious events that the investigator assesses as related to axicabtagene ciloleucel should be 
reported regardless of the study period. 
All SAEs must be submitted via email to 
 within 24 hours following 
the investigator’s knowledge of the event and using a SAE Report Form.  
Subsequently, all serious adverse events will be reported to the health authorities per local 
reporting guidelines. 
Progression of the malignancy during the study should not be reported as a serious adverse 
event. Adverse events associated with disease progression may be reported as serious adverse 
events.  If the malignancy has a fatal outcome within 3 months of the last day of the 
conditioning therapy or axicabtagene ciloleucel, then the event leading to death must be 
recorded as a serious adverse event with CTCAE Grade 5. 
Death must be reported if it occurs during the serious adverse event reporting period, 
irrespective of any intervening treatment. 
Any death occurring after the first dose of chemotherapy, for the purpose of pre-
conditioning, and within 3 months of the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, regardless of 
attribution to treatment, requires expedited reporting within 24 hours.  Any death occurring 
greater than 3 months after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion requires expedited reporting 
within 24 hours only if it is considered related to treatment. 
9.5. 
Reporting Deaths 
Deaths that occur during the protocol-specified adverse event reporting period that are 
attributed by the investigator solely to progression of underlying lymphoma should be 
recorded as serious adverse events (SAEs) with the preferred term “B-cell lymphoma” and 
must be reported immediately to the sponsor.  Death is an outcome and not a distinct event.  
The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded on 
the AE form.  The term “unexplained death” should be captured if the cause of death is not 
known.  However, every effort should be made to capture the established cause of death, 
which may become available later on (eg, after autopsy). Deaths during the post-study 
survival follow-up due to underlying cancer should be recorded only on the Survival Status 
CRF.

9.6. 
Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms 
For adverse events, a diagnosis (if known) rather than individual signs and symptoms should 
be recorded on the AE form.  The exception is for CRS where both the diagnosis and signs 
and symptoms will be captured on the CRF AE form.  For signs and symptoms of the 
underlying cancer, the signs and symptoms should be captured.  However, on the AE form, 
the investigator should state that these signs and symptoms are due to the underlying disease. 
9.7. 
Pregnancy and Lactation 
There is no relevant clinical experience with axicabtagene ciloleucel in pregnant or lactating 
women, and animal reproductive studies have not been performed.  Women of childbearing 
potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment because of the potentially 
dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus.  Women of childbearing 
potential should be monitored according to local and country-specific regulations. This 
experimental therapy should not be administered to pregnant women or women who are 
breastfeeding. 
Female subjects and female partners of male subjects are recommended to use highly 
effective contraception (method must achieve an annual failure rate of < 1%) through at least 
6 months after conditioning chemotherapy dosing or axicabtagene ciloleucel dosing, 
whichever is longer. Male subjects are recommended not to father a child for at least 
6 months after completing conditioning chemotherapy dosing or axicabtagene ciloleucel 
dosing, whichever is longer.  
If a pregnancy occurs in a female subject enrolled into the study, or a female partner of a 
male subject, within 6 months of completing the conditioning chemotherapy or 
axicabtagene ciloleucel dosing (whichever is longer), the pregnancy must be reported to 
the key sponsor contact.  Information regarding the pregnancy and/or the outcome may be 
requested by the key sponsor.  
The pregnancy should be reported to the key sponsor contact within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy event.  
If a lactation case occurs while the female subject is taking protocol required therapies report 
the lactation case to the key sponsor contact. 
In addition to reporting a lactation case during the study, investigators should monitor for 
lactation cases that occur after the last dose of protocol required therapies through 6 months. 
Any lactation case should be reported to the key sponsor contact within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event. 
9.8. 
Hospitalization and Prolonged Hospitalization 
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be 
documented and reported as a serious adverse event as described in Section 9.4.

The following hospitalization scenarios are not considered to be serious adverse events: 
 Hospitalization for palliative care or hospice care 
 Planned hospitalization required by the protocol (eg, for monitoring of the subject or to 
perform an efficacy measurement for the study) 
 Planned hospitalization for a pre-existing condition 
 Hospitalization due to progression of the underlying cancer 
9.9. 
Abnormal Vital Sign Values 
Not all vital sign abnormalities qualify as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must be 
reported as an adverse event if it is a change from baseline and meets any of the following 
criteria: 
 Accompanied by clinical symptoms 
 Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy 
 Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should 
be classified as an adverse event.  However, if a clinically significant vital sign abnormality 
is a sign of a disease or syndrome (eg, high blood pressure), only the diagnosis 
(ie, hypertension) should be recorded on the CRF. 
9.10. 
Safety Review Team and Dose-limiting Toxicity 
Phase 1 Study 
The SRT will be specifically chartered to review safety data during Phase 1 of the study and 
make recommendations on further study conduct in Phase 1 and progression to Phase 2 based 
on the incidence of axicabtagene ciloleucel DLT and review of serious adverse events.    
Dose-limiting toxicity is defined as the following axicabtagene ciloleucel-related events with 
onset within the first 30 days following axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion: 
 Grade 4 neutropenia lasting longer than 21 days from the day of cell transfer 
 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting longer than 35 days from the day of cell transfer 
 Any axicabtagene ciloleucel-related adverse event requiring intubation, including 
Grade 4 confusion requiring intubation for airway protection is considered to be a DLT.

 All other Grade 3 toxicities lasting more than 3 days and all Grade 4 toxicities, with the 
exception of the following conditions which are not considered DLTs: 
 Aphasia/dysphasia or confusion/cognitive disturbance which resolves to Grade 1 or less 
within 2 weeks and to baseline within 4 weeks 
 Fever Grade 3   
 Myelosuppression (includes bleeding in the setting of platelet count less than 50 x109/L 
and documented bacterial infections in the setting of neutropenia), defined as 
lymphopenia, decreased hemoglobin, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia unless 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia meet the DLT definition described above 
 Immediate hypersensitivity reactions occurring within 2 hours of cell infusion (related to 
cell infusion) that are reversible to a Grade 2 or less within 24 hours of cell 
administration with standard therapy 
 Hypogammaglobulinemia Grade 3 or 4 
As noted in Section 6.4 CRS will be graded according to a revised grading system (Lee et al, 
2014).  Adverse events attributed to CRS will be mapped to the overall CRS grading 
assessment for the determination of DLT.   
During Phase 1, approximately 6 to 24 subjects with DLBCL, PMBCL, or TFL will be 
enrolled to evaluate the safety of axicabtagene ciloleucel regimens.   
Subjects in each cohort will be evaluated for DLTs within the first 30 days following the 
completion of their respective axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  The analysis of DLTs will 
be based on the DLT evaluable set as defined in Section 10.5 .  The SRT will make 
recommendations based on the incidence of DLT and overall safety profile of the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel regimen.  If the subject incidence of DLT is ≤ 1 of 6 subjects, Cohort 
B1 may be explored or the study may proceed to Phase 2 of the trial.  This decision will be 
based on overall benefit/risk and available biomarker data.  
However, if 2 of the 6 enrolled subjects present with a protocol defined DLT during Phase 1, 
the SRT may recommend enrolling 2 additional sets of 3 subjects (up to 12 subjects in total) 
at the same dose that was administered in the first 6 subjects.  In this scenario, progression to 
an additional cohort or to Phase 2 of the study will proceed if ≤ 2 of the first 9 or if ≤ 3 of the 
12 subjects present with a DLT.  
If the subject incidence of DLT is > 2/6, > 3/9, or > 4/12 subjects, other axicabtagene 
ciloleucel regimens may be explored in an additional 6 to 12 subjects (Figure 3).  The same 
DLT rules apply as above.

Data Safety Monitoring Board 
Phase 2 Pivotal Study 
 
 
  The DSMB will review safety and efficacy data and be 
chartered to make trial conduct recommendations based on an analysis of risk vs. benefit. 
Phase 2 Safety Management Study 
The DSMB will also meet to review safety data when 20 subjects in Cohort 3, Cohort 4, 
Cohort 5, and Cohort 6 have been treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel and have had the 
opportunity to be followed for 30 days, respectively.  The DSMB may meet more often as 
needed. In addition, Kite Pharma or delegate will submit SAEs or suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) to the DSMB chair for risk benefit analysis.  The DSMB 
Chair will review reported SAEs at least monthly and SUSARs as soon as received.   
9.12. 
Criteria to Pause Enrollment 
Phase 2 Pivotal Study 
As part of its oversight of the study, the DSMB also will assess criteria to pause enrollment 
after 10, 20, 30, and 50 subjects in the Phase 2 pivotal portion of the study have been treated 
with axicabtagene ciloleucel and have had the opportunity to be followed for 30 days.  
Enrollment will be paused if any of the following criteria is met: 
1) Subject incidence of Grade 5 axicabtagene ciloleucel-related adverse events within 
30 days is > 10%. 
or 
2) Subject incidence of the following Grade 4 axicabtagene ciloleucel-related adverse events 
lasting more than 7 days is > 33%: 
 Neurologic toxicities 
 CRS (per Lee 2014 criteria) (Lee et al, 2014) 
 Other non-hematological serious adverse event 
 Infection (treatment-related)

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The primary objective of the Phase 1 Study is to evaluate the safety of axicabtagene 
ciloleucel regimens.  The primary objective of the pivotal Phase 2 portion is to evaluate the 
efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel, as measured by ORR in subjects with DLBCL, PMBCL, 
and TFL.  Secondary objectives will include assessing the safety and tolerability of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel and additional efficacy endpoints.  Inferential testing will only be 
performed for efficacy for Phase 2 pivotal study Cohort 1 and Cohort 2.  For the Phase 2 
safety management study, Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6, the primary objective 
is to assess the impact of prophylactic regimens, earlier interventions, debulking therapy, or 
prophylactic steroids on the rate and severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities. 
10.1. 
Hypothesis 
Phase 2 pivotal study Cohort 1 and Cohort 2:  This study is designed to differentiate between 
a treatment that has a true response rate of 20% or less and a treatment with a true response 
rate of 40% or more.  The hypothesis is that the ORR to axicabtagene ciloleucel in Cohort 1 
and Cohort 2 is significantly greater than 20%. 
Phase 2 safety management study Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6:  No 
hypothesis will be tested in Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6, which will be used 
to assess the impact of prophylactic regimens, earlier interventions, debulking therapy, or 
prophylactic steroids on the rate and severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities.

Study Endpoints 
10.2.1. 
Primary 
Phase 1 study:  Incidence of adverse events defined as DLT. 
Phase 2 pivotal study:  ORR, defined as the incidence of either a complete response or a 
partial response by the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et 
al, 2007) as determined by the study investigators.  All subjects who do not meet the criteria 
for an objective response by the analysis data cutoff date will be considered non-responders.  
Phase 2 safety management study:  incidence and severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities. 
10.2.2. 
Secondary 
Duration of response (DOR): Among subjects who experience an objective response, DOR 
is defined as the date of their first objective response (which is subsequently confirmed) to 
disease progression per the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma 
(Cheson et al, 2007) or death regardless of cause. Subjects not meeting the criteria for 
progression or death by the analysis data cutoff date will be censored at their last evaluable 
disease assessment date and their response will be noted as ongoing.

In the Phase 2 safety management study, approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled into 
Cohort 3, approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled and dosed into Cohort 4, approximately 
50 subjects will be enrolled and dosed into Cohort 5, and approximately 40 subjects will be 
enrolled and dosed into Cohort 6. 
ORR and all analyses based on the objective response (objective response, duration of 
response, progression-free survival) in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of the study will be 
based on a mITT population consisting of all subjects who receive the target dose of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel.   
 
  For Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6, the primary objective will be to 
assess the impact of prophylactic regimens, earlier interventions, debulking therapy, or 
prophylactic steroids on the rate and severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities.  ORR with 
axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment in subjects with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, PMBCL, 
TFL, or HGBCL in Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6 will be a secondary 
endpoint, and the analysis will be descriptive.  
10.3.1. 
Phase 2 Pivotal Study, Cohort 1, and Cohort 2 
This study uses a single arm design to test for an improvement in response rate 
 
.  For the test 
of efficacy this study has ≥ 90% power to distinguish between an active therapy with a 40% 
true response rate from a therapy with a response rate of 20% or less with a 1-sided alpha 
level of 0.025.

 The primary analysis of Cohort 1 will occur after 72 subjects in the mITT set have had 
the opportunity to be assessed for response 6 months after the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
infusion.  The nominal alpha level for the assessment of efficacy at the primary analysis 
is 0.011. 
 
   
For Cohorts 1 and 2 combined, 1 primary analysis will be performed when 72 subjects in the 
mITT set in Cohort 1 and 20 subjects in the mITT set in Cohort 2 have had the opportunity to 
be assessed for response 6 months after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  This testing 
will be performed at a 1-sided alpha level of 0.0075.  Descriptive confidence intervals about 
the ORRs within Cohorts 1 and 2 will be presented with the inferential analysis of Cohorts 1 
and 2 combined. 
As indicated above, inferential testing of Cohort 1 will occur when 72 subjects in the mITT 
set in Cohort 1 have had the opportunity to be followed for 6 months after the axicabtagene 
ciloleucel infusion.  The efficacy data from any additional subjects (beyond 72) enrolled into 
Cohort 1 will be analyzed descriptively.  Similarly, inferential testing of Cohorts 1 and 2 will 
occur when 72 subjects in the mITT set of Cohort 1 and 20 subjects in the mITT set of 
Cohort 2 have had the opportunity to be followed for 6 months following the axicabtagene 
ciloleucel infusion.  The efficacy data from any additional subjects (beyond 92) enrolled into 
Cohorts 1 and 2 will be analyzed descriptively.   
The derivation of the alpha levels for the test of Cohort 1 and the overall study population 
were originally obtained under the assumption of 40 subjects enrolled into Cohort 2.  These 
original derivations are retained in this protocol amendment as they result in a more 
conservative alpha level for the test of Cohort 1.   
This procedure preserves the designated alpha level (1-sided) of 0.025 and has ≥ 90% power.  
 
 
10.3.2. 
Phase 2 Safety Management Study  
The primary objective of Phase 2 safety management study Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, 
and Cohort 6 is to assess the impact of prophylactic regimens, earlier interventions, 
debulking therapy, or prophylactic steroids on the rate and severity of CRS and neurologic 
toxicities.  The assessment of ORR is a secondary objective, and the analysis will be 
descriptive.

Statistical Assumptions 
Phase 1 Study 
The primary endpoint for the Phase 1 portion of the study is the incidence of DLT. 
Phase 2 Pivotal Study 
Cohorts 1 and 2 of this trial will enroll subjects with chemo-refractory lymphoma, as 
evidenced by failure to achieve even a transient or partial response to prior biologic and 
combination chemotherapy or by early recurrence after ASCT. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
Phase 2 Safety Management Study 
Analyses of the safety and efficacy endpoints will be descriptive, with no formal statistical 
testing being performed.  Subject incidence rates of treatment-emergent CRS, neurologic 
toxicities, axicabtagene ciloleucel-related adverse events, and ORRs will be summarized by 
cohort.  DOR, PFS, and OS will also be summarized by cohort.  
10.5. 
Analysis Subsets   
10.5.1. 
Phase 1 Study 
Depending on the dosing cohort and results of the Phase 1 portion of the study, axicabtagene 
ciloleucel may be: 
 administered as a single infusion at a target dose of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg 
(± 20%).  For subjects weighing greater than 100 kg, a maximum flat dose of 2 x 108 
anti-CD19 CAR T cells will be administered. A minimum dose of 1 x 106 anti-CD19 
CAR T cells/kg may be administered; or 
 administered as a single infusion at a target dose of 1 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg 
(± 20%) in the Phase 2 portion of the study. In this case, for subjects weighing greater 
than 
 anti-CD19 CAR T cells will be 
administered. A 
 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg may be 
administered. 
The DLT evaluable set (Phase 1 only), defined for each dosing cohort in Phase 1, will 
include subjects treated in the Phase 1 dosing cohort who:

 received the target and were followed for at least 30 days after the anti-CD19 CAR T cell 
infusion; or  
 received a dose of anti-CD19 CAR T cells lower than the target for that cohort and 
experienced a DLT during the 30 day post-infusion period.   
If needed, more subjects will be enrolled to achieve 6 DLT evaluable subjects at the target 
dose for each cohort.  
Safety set:  the safety set is defined as all subjects treated with any dose of axicabtagene 
ciloleucel. 
10.5.2. 
Phase 2 Study   
In the Phase 2 portion of the study (including the Phase 2 pivotal study and SMS), subjects 
are to be dosed at a target of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg.  A minimum dose of 1 x 106 
anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg may be administered.  For subjects weighing greater than 100 kg, 
a maximum flat dose of 2 x 108 anti-CD19 CAR T cells will be administered.  Subjects are 
considered to have received the target dose if they receive 1 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg 
up to 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg or, if the subject weighs more than 100 kg, the 
subject receives 2 x 108 anti-CD19 CAR T cells.  
Modified Intent-to-Treat Set:  the mITT set will consist of all subjects enrolled and treated 
with axicabtagene ciloleucel at a dose of at least 1 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg.   
This analysis set will be used for all analyses of objective response and endpoints based on 
objective response (objective response, duration of response, progression-free survival) for 
both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of the study (including both pivotal and SMS). 
Safety analysis set:  the safety analysis set is defined as all subjects treated with any dose of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
Full Analysis set (FAS):  the full analysis set will consist of all enrolled subjects and will be 
used for the summary of subject disposition, sensitivity analyses of ORR and DOR, and 
subject listings of deaths. 
10.6. 
Access to Individual Subject Treatment Assignments 
This is a single arm, open-label study and subjects and investigators will be aware of 
treatment received.  Data handling procedures for the Phase 2 portion of the study will be 
devised to reduce potential sources of bias and maintain the validity and credibility of the 
study.  These procedures will be outlined in the study statistical analysis plan, DSMB charter, 
and Trial Integrity Document.

Interim Analysis and Early Stopping Rules 
Phase 1 Study 
The SRT will be chartered to review safety during Phase 1 of the study only and make 
recommendations on further study conduct in Phase 1 and progression to Phase 2.   
Phase 2 Pivotal Study 
An independent DSMB will be formed to review accumulating safety and efficacy data  
 
   
The DSMB will also monitor criteria to pause enrollment (see Section 9.12). 
Phase 2 Safety Management Study 
The DSMB will review safety data when 20 subjects treated in Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, 
and Cohort 6 have had the opportunity to be followed for 30 days, respectively.   
10.7.2. 
Safety Interim Analysis 
The DSMB will review AE and SAE information on a regular basis throughout subject 
treatment in Phase 2 of the study.  The DSMB may request additional safety data or to 
modify the study conduct.  The sponsor may request additional reviews by the DSMB if 
safety concerns are identified. Data submitted to the DSMB may be monitored or 
unmonitored to facilitate timely DSMB review.

Planned Method of Analysis 
Phase 1 Study 
Descriptive analysis of the Phase 1 portion of the study may occur at any time. 
Phase 2 Pivotal Study  
The primary efficacy analyses of Cohort 1 will be performed when 72 subjects in the mITT 
set of Cohort 1 have had the opportunity to be evaluated for response 6 months after the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  The primary analysis of Cohorts 1 and 2 combined will be 
performed when 72 subjects in the mITT set of Cohort 1 and 20 subjects in the mITT set of 
Cohort 2 have had the opportunity to be evaluated for response at 6 months after the target 
axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  Additional analyses may occur after the primary analysis.  
These additional analyses will be descriptive and will occur after inferential testing has been 
performed.  The final analysis will occur when all subjects have completed the study.  
The primary endpoint of ORR for all analyses (
 primary) will be based 
on investigator review of disease assessments in the mITT set.  For Cohorts 1 and 2, 
sensitivity analyses of ORR based on central radiologic review of disease assessments will be 
performed. 
Analyses of efficacy endpoints will be summarized by study phase, for Cohort 1 alone, for 
Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 combined, and for Cohort 3 alone.  Analyses of safety endpoints will 
be evaluated by study phase, cohort, Cohort 1 and 2 combined.  
Phase 2 Safety Management Study 
The primary analysis of Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6 will occur after all 
treated subjects in each cohort have had the opportunity to be followed for 6 months, 
respectively.  The ORR in Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6 will be based on 
investigator review of disease assessment in the mITT set.  No central radiologic review of 
disease assessment will be performed for these cohorts. 
Descriptive analyses of the Phase 2 SMS Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6 may 
occur at any time.

10.8.1. 
Objective Response Rate 
The incidence of objective response and exact 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be 
generated.  For the Phase 2 pivotal study, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, an exact binomial test will 
be used to compare the observed response rate to a response rate of 20%. 
10.8.2. 
Duration of Response 
Kaplan-Meier estimates and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be generated for duration 
of response. Estimates of the proportion of subjects in response at 3-month intervals from the 
first response will be provided. The competing-risk analysis method (Pepe 1991; Fine and 
Gray 1999) may be used to estimate the cumulative incidence of relapse.  The cumulative 
incidence of relapse in the presence of non-disease related mortality (the competing risk) 
may be estimated along with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals at 3-month intervals.   
10.8.3. 
Progression-free Survival 
Kaplan-Meier estimates and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be generated for 
progression-free survival time.  Estimates of the proportion of subjects alive and progression-
free at 3-month intervals will be provided. 
10.8.4. 
Overall Survival 
Kaplan-Meier estimates and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be generated for OS.  
Estimates of the proportion of subjects alive at 3-month intervals will be provided. 
10.8.5. 
Safety 
Subject incidence rates of adverse events including all, serious, fatal, CTCAE version 4 
Grade 3 or higher and treatment related AEs reported throughout the conduct of the study 
will be tabulated by preferred term and system organ class.  Changes in laboratory values and 
 will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  
 
 
For Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6, the incidences and severity of CRS and 
neurologic toxicities may be compared to the rates in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 combined with a 
binomial test.   
Tables and/or narratives of deaths through the long term follow-up and treatment related 
SAEs will be provided. 
10.8.6. 
Long-term Data Analysis 
All subjects will be followed for survival for up to approximately 15 years after the last 
subject receives axicabtagene ciloleucel.  No formal hypothesis testing will be performed 
based on data obtained after the cutoff for the primary analysis.  Descriptive estimates of key 
efficacy and safety analyses may be updated to assess the overall treatment profile.

Appendix A 
Revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma  
(Cheson et al, 2007) 
Complete Remission (CR):  CR requires all of the following:  
 Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related 
symptoms if present before therapy.  
 Typically FDG-avid lymphoma (large cell, mantle cell and follicular lymphomas are all 
typically FDG-avid):  in subjects with no pretreatment PET scan or when the PET scan 
was positive before therapy, a post-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as 
long as it is PET negative.   
 Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown:  in subjects without a 
pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, all lymph nodes and 
nodal masses must have regressed to normal size (≤ 1.5 cm in greatest diameter if > 
1.5 cm before therapy).  Previously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in their long 
axis and more than 1 cm in their short axis before treatment must have decreased to ≤ 
1.0 cm in their short axis after treatment.   
 The spleen and/or liver, if considered to be enlarged before therapy on basis of physical 
exam or CT scan, must should be normal size on CT scan and not be palpable on physical 
examination and nodules thought to represent lymphoma must no longer be present.   
 A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy is performed only when the patient had bone marrow 
involvement with lymphoma prior to therapy or if new abnormalities in the peripheral 
blood counts or blood smear cause clinical suspicion of bone marrow involvement with 
lymphoma after treatment.  The bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must show no evidence 
of disease by morphology or if indeterminate by morphology it must be negative by 
immunohistochemistry.  The biopsy core sample must be a minimum of 20 mm in length.  
Partial Remission (PR): PR requires all of the following: 
 ≥ 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest 
dominant nodes or nodal masses.  Dominant nodes or nodal masses should be clearly 
measurable in at least 2 perpendicular dimensions, should be from different regions of the 
body if possible and should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal nodes if possible.   
 No increase in size of nodes, liver or spleen and no new sites of disease.   
 If multiple splenic and hepatic nodules are present, they must regress by ≥ 50% in the 
SPD.  There must be a > 50% decrease in the greatest transverse diameter for single 
nodules.

11 February 2019 
 
 Bone marrow is irrelevant for determination of a PR.  If patient has persistent bone 
marrow involvement and otherwise meets criteria for CR the patient will be considered a 
PR. 
 Typically FDG-avid lymphoma:  for subjects with no pretreatment PET scan or if the 
PET scan was positive before therapy, the post-treatment PET scan should be positive in 
at least one previously involved site.  Note: in subjects with follicular lymphoma or 
mantle-cell lymphoma, a PET scan is only indicated in subjects with one or at most two 
residual masses that have regressed by 50% on CT scan. 
Stable Disease (SD):  
 Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.  
PET should be positive in typically FDG-avid lymphomas. 
Progressive Disease:  
Defined by at least one of the following:   
 ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the sum of the products of at least two lymph nodes, or if a 
single node is involved at least a 50% increase in the product of the diameters of this one 
node.   
 Appearance of a new lesion greater than 1.5 cm in any axis even if other lesions are 
decreasing in size 
 Greater than or equal to a 50% increase in size of splenic or hepatic nodules  
 At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node 
more than 1 cm in its short axis.  
 Lesions should be PET positive in typically FDG-avid lymphomas unless the lesion is too 
small to be detected by PET (< 1.5 cm in its long axis by CT)

Appendix B 
Monitoring of subjects after IP administration per country regulatory 
agencies: 
Germany: 
The post-infusion monitoring of subjects, described in Section 7.13.7.2 in this protocol, will be 
extended by monitoring on Day 8, Day 9, and Day 10, according to procedures outlined in 
Table 11, column “IP administration period, 1-7”. The subject may stay hospitalized or return to 
the clinic daily for this extended monitoring at the discretion of the investigator.  
The daily monitoring will include vital signs (see Section 7.4), blood draw for chemistry panel 
with CRP, blood draw for CBC w/differential (see Section 7.11), and neurological assessment. 
Any observed toxicity will be managed according to Section 6.4 of this protocol.  
France: 
The post-infusion monitoring of subjects in this protocol will be extended by monitoring on 
Day 8, Day 9, and Day 10, according to procedures outlined in Table 11, column “IP 
administration period, 1-7.” The L'Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament et des 
produits de santé (ANSM) recommends a 10-day hospitalization after infusion of any CAR 
T-cell product.   
The daily monitoring will include vital signs (see Section 6.4), blood draw for chemistry 
panel with CRP, blood draw for CBC w/differential (see Section 7.11), and neurological 
assessment. Any observed toxicity will be evaluated according to Section 6.4 of this 
protocol.
