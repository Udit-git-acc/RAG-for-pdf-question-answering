D\\nISEASE BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  \\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a heterogeneous group of cancers originating in B \\nlymphocytes, T lymphocytes or natural killer cells.  In the United States, B cell lymphomas \\nrepresent 80-85% of cases reported.  In 2013, appr\\noximately 69,740 new cases of NHL and over \\n19,000 deaths related to the disease were estimated to occur.  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the \\nmost prevalent hematological malignancy and is the seventh leading site of new cancers among \\nmen and women and account for 4% of all new cancer cases and 3% of deaths related to cancer \\n(Howlader et al, 2017 ).  Large B-cell lymphomas represent the most common sub-group of NHL \\n(Rodriguez-Abreu et al, 2007 ). \\n2.1. Dif fuse Large B-cell Lymphoma  \\nDLBCL is the most common subtype of large B-cell lymphoma, accounting for approximately \\n30% of NHL cases.  There are approximately\\n 22,000 new diagnoses of DLBCL in the United \\nStates each year.  In the past two decades, pro\\ngress has been made in understanding the \\nbiological heterogeneity of DLBCL and in improving survival with combinations of CHOP and \\nimmunotherapy.  The addition of rituximab into combination therapies for DLBCL have greatly \\nimproved patient outcomes.  However, patients with chemotherapy-refractory DLBCL following \\ntreatment under the current standards of care still have a particularly dire prognosis, with no \\ncurative treatment options (Flowers et al, 2010 ). \\nThe population with the highest unmet need continues to consist of patients who do not respond \\nto first line combination chemotherapy (typically R-CHOP) or who do not respond to their last \\ncourse of combination chemotherapy, as the disease is mostly insensitive to subsequent \\ncombination chemotherapy (typically R-I\\nCE, R-ESHAP) ( Table 1).  In a review of 64 patients \\nwith D\\nLBCL with disease progression during first line chemotherapy or only transient response \\n(≤90 days) after end of induction treatment, the response rate to second line therapy was \\n15% and the median overall survival (OS) was 6 months, and no patient survived more than \\n26 months after first diagnosis (J osting et al, 2000 ).  An analysis of outcome in 1126 patients \\nwith DLBCL after first line R-CHOP included 33 patients wi\\nth primary refractory DLBCL who \\nreceived second line therapy with curative intent.  Only 3 (9%) patients were able to receive \\nautologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), and only 1 (3%) patient achieved long term \\nsurvival (Hitz et al, 2010 ).  Seshadri et al analyzed 120 patients who did not respond to \\nsecond line platinum-based chemotherapy regimens (e.g., R-ICE) and showed that only \\n14% responded to their third line therapy (S eshadri et al, 2008 ).  Ardeshna et al followed \\n19 patients with large B-cell lymphoma, and 9 patients with TFL who did not respond to \\nsecond line chemotherapy.  Only 5 of the 28 total patients (18%) responded to third line \\nchemotherapy (Ardeshna et al, 2005 ).', metadata={'source': 'protocol.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",

P rimary Mediastinal B-cell Lymphoma and Transformed Follicular \\nLymphoma  \\nPMB CL has distinct clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics compared to DLBCL.  \\nPMBCL is thought to arise from thymic (medullary) B cells and represents approximately 3% of \\npatients diagnosed with large B-cell lymphoma.  PMBCL is typica\\nlly identified in the younger \\nadult population in the fourth decade of life with a slight female predominance (Sehn et al, 1998 ; \\nSavage et al, 2006 ).  Gene expression profiling suggests deregulated pathways in PMBCL \\noverlap with Hodgkin lymphoma.  Initial therapy of PMBCL generally includes anthracycline-\\ncontaining regimens with rituximab with or without involved field radiotherapy.  A recent \\nPhase 2, prospective study of infusional dose-adjusted etoposide, doxorubicin, and \\ncyclophosphamide with vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) demonstrated \\nradiotherapy may not be required (Dunleavy et al, 2013 ).', metadata={'source': 'protocol.pdf', 'page': 21}),\n",

Some patients with FL \\nwill transform (TFL) histologically to DLBCL which is more aggressive and associated with a \\npoor outcome.  Histological transformation to DLBCL occurs at an annual rate of approximately \\n3% for 15 years with the risk of transformation continuing to drop in subsequent years.  The \\nbiologic mechanism of histologic transformation is unknown.  Initial treatment of TFL is \\ninfluenced by prior therapies for follicular lymphoma but generally includes \\nanthracycline-containing regimens with rituximab to eliminate the aggressive component of the \\ndisease ( National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2014 ). \\nTr\\neatment options for relapsed/refractory PMBCL and TFL are similar to those in DLBCL.  \\nGiven the low prevalence of these diseases, no large prospective randomized studies in these \\npatient populations have been conducted.  Patients with chemotherapy refractory disease have a \\nsimilar or worse prognosis (Kuruvilla et al, 2008 ) \\nto those with refractory DLBCL. \\nIn addition, the international, multicohort retrospective non-Hodgkin lymphoma research \\n(SCHOLAR-1) study retrospectively evaluated outcomes in patients with chemorefractory \\nDLBCL, PMBCL, and TFL.  SCHOLAR-1 integrated data from two Phase 3 studies \\n(LYSARC-CORAL and Canadian Cancer Trials Group LY.12) and 2 observational cohorts \\n(MD Anderson Cancer Center and Mayo Clinic/University of Iowa Specialized Program of \\nR\\nesearch Excellence).  Among 861 patients, 635 were included based on chemorefractory search \\ncriteria.  Outcomes were consistently poor, regardless of refractory subgroup and across cohorts.  \\nThe results of SCHOLAR-1 indicated that patients with chemorefractory, aggressive DLBCL \\nrepresent a homogenous patient population with a response rate of 26% (complete response [CR] \\nrate of 7%) and median overall survival of 6.3 months ( Crump et al, 2017 ). \\n2.3. Hi gh Grade B-cell Lymphoma  \\nIn 2016, the World Health Organization introduced a new category of large B-cell lymphomas \\ncalled high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) (Swerdlow et al, 2016 ).  This designation includes \\nlarge B-cell lymphomas with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements that are \\nphenotypically intermediate to D\\nLBCL or B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable (this latter category \\nhas since been eliminated).  MYC rearrangements in large B-cell lymphomas are associated with \\na poor prognosis that is worsened in cases of concomitant BCL2 and/or BCL6 alterations, \\nie, double- or triple-hit lymphomas.  As such, patients with HGBCL are likely to face poor \\nsurviva\\nl outcomes. \\nIn summary, axicabtag\\nene ciloleucel may provide a viable treatment option to relapsed/refractory \\nlarge B-cell lymphoma patients with no other curative alternatives. \\n2.4. Study Rationale  \\nAs most advanced cancers eventually become refractory to conventional therapies, new \\ntreatment modalities are needed.  Immunotherapy, which is based on the enhancement of an \\nimmune response against the tumor, is a promising approach to treating many cancer types.  \\nT cells play an important role in destroying diseased cells throughout the body.

T cells need to possess the appropriate specificity for a tumor, \\nbe\\n present in sufficient numbers, and overcome any local immunosuppressive factors to be \\neffective.  Engineered T cells are a promising approach for cancer therapy (Kershaw et al, 2013 ). \\nEngineered autologous ce ll therapy (eACT™) is a process by which a patient’s own T cells are \\ncollected and subsequently genetically altered to recognize and target antigens expressed on the \\ncell surface of specific malignancies (Kochenderfer et al, 2013 ).  The ability to genetically \\ne\\nngineer human T cells and use them to mediate cancer regression in patients has been \\ndemonstrated in a number of studies and has opened possibilities for the treatment of patients \\nwith a wide variety of cancer types including B cell malignancies expressing the CD19 antigen. \\n2.4.1. CD 19 and Expression  \\nCD19 is a 95 kDa transmembrane protein expressed only in the B cell lineage.  It is expressed in \\nall normal B cells starting at the pre-B cell stage until t\\nhe final differentiation stage and is not \\nexpressed in pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells or most plasma cells.  The pattern of CD19 \\nexpression is maintained in B cell malignancies including all subtypes of B cell NHL, chronic \\nlymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and non-T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Blanc et al, \\n2011)  with t he exception of multiple myeloma. \\n2.4.2. Anti -CD19 CAR T-cell Product  \\nAnti-CD19 CAR T cells are autologous human T cells that have been engineered to express an \\nextracellular single-chain variable fragment (scFv) with s\\npecificity for CD19 linked to an \\nintracellular signaling part comprised of signaling domains from CD28 and CD3 ζ (CD3-zeta) \\nmolecules arranged in tandem.  \\nAn anti-CD19 CAR vector construct has been designed, optimized and initially tested at the \\nSurgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute (NCI, IND 13871) (Figure 2)  (Ko chenderfer et \\nal, 2009 ; Kochenderfer et al, 2010 ).  The scFv is derived from the variable region of the \\nanti-CD19 monoclonal antibody FMC63 (Nicholson et al, 1997 ).  A portion of the CD28 \\ncostimulatory molecule is added, as murine models suggest this is important for the anti-tumor \\neffect and persistence of anti-CD19 CAR T cells (Kowolik et al, 2006 ).  The signaling domain of \\nthe CD3-zeta chain is essential for T cell activation.  These fragments were cloned into the \\nmurine stem  vector, utilized to genetically engineer the autologous T \\ncells.  Treatment with anti-CD19 CAR T cells is currently being a\\ndministered to subjects with \\nCD19+ B cell malignancies in ongoing NCI protocol (09-C-0082; IND 13871).    \\n \\nThe CAR c\\nonstruct is inserted into the T ce\\nlls’ genome by retroviral vector transduction.  \\nBriefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are obtained by leukapheresis and Ficoll \\nseparation.   \\n  Stimulated cells are transduced \\nwith a retroviral vector containing an anti-CD19 CAR gene and propagated in culture to generate \\nsufficient engineered T cells for administration.   \\nCCI\\nCCI\\nCCI', metadata={'source': 'protocol.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",

Rat ionale for Study Treatment Dosing  \\n6.3.3.1. Rationale for Conditioning Chemotherapy Dose in Phase 1 Cohort A1 \\nIncreasing levels of conditioning chemotherapy correlates with clinical responses to adoptive cell \\ntherapy (Dudley et al, 2008 ).  Specifically, there appears to be a link between adequate \\nlymphodepletion and adoptively transferred T cell expansion and function in pre-clinical models.  \\nThe depth and duration of the lymphodepletion in preclinical models correlate with anti-tumor \\nactivity of the adoptively transferred tumor-specific CD8+ T cells (Gattinoni et al, 2005 ).  \\nLymphodepletion may function by eradicating cytokine sinks for the transferred cells, \\neliminating T regulatory cells, or enhancing antigen presenting cell activation (Klebanoff et al, \\n2005) .  C yclophosphamide and fludarabine is a potent lymphodepleting regimen.  Optimizing the \\ndoses of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to impr\\nove the depth and duration of \\nlymphodepletion may enhance the activity of axicabtagene ciloleucel.   \\nAs described in the IB, the NCI study (09-C-0082; IND 13871) evaluated three groups of \\nsubj\\nects based on conditioning regimens.  \\nGroup 3 evaluated cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2) \\nand fludarabine (30 mg/m2), both given for 3 concurrent days followed by 1-2 x 106 anti-CD19 \\nC\\nAR T cells.  Eleven subjects were treated with this regimen.   \\nThe DLT definition in the KTE-C19-101 study was applied to the NCI study (09-C-0082; \\nIND 13871) data in group 3.  There were no DLTs.  The subject incidences of Grade 3, 4, 5, and \\nse\\nrious adverse events attributed to CAR+ T-cells were 3 (27%), 0 (0%), 0 (0%), and 1 (9%).  \\nThe ORR in this cohort was 60%, including 10% complete responses.  Many subjects, however, \\ndid not\\n achieve blood lymphocyte counts of ze\\nro with this conditioning regimen. \\nTo improve the depth and duration of lymphocyte depletion, the conditioning chemotherapy dose \\nin Phase 1 Cohort A1 will be cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) and fludarabine (30 mg/m2) both \\ngiven for 3 conc\\nurrent days with the target dose of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg.

Currently it is \\nh\\nypothesized that there are two potential mechanisms of the pathophysiology of neurologic \\ntoxicities:  1) peripheral systemic cytokine release followed by cytokine diffusion across the \\nblood brain barrier (BBB) and/or 2) peripherally activated anti\\n-CD19 CAR T cells translocate \\nacross the BBB and elicits a local inflammatory effect.  The later hypothesis is supported by \\nemerging evidence of CAR T-cells trafficking to the CSF.  To further elucidate the \\npathophysiology of neurologic toxicities, serial CSF collections will be analyzed in this study for \\ncytokines/chemokines/effector molecules and anti-CD19 CAR T cells. In addition, in an attempt \\nto mitigate the onset and severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities, prophylactic tocilizumab and \\nlevetiracetam will be administered in Cohort 3 (see Section 6.3.4).  It is hypothesized that \\ntocili\\nzumab may lead to fewer activated CAR T-cells trafficking to the CNS and levetiracetam  \\nmay reduce the risk of clinical or subclinical seizures.  Lastly, in an effort to mitigate the severity \\nand/or duration of the neurologic toxicities, IT-Ara C with corticosteroids is recommended to be \\nadministered at the onset of Grade 3 neurologic toxicities (see Section 6.4.1) . \\n6.3.3.4.2.\\n Cohort 4 and Cohort 6 \\nI\\nn the Phase 2 pivotal study portion of ZUMA-1 (n = 101), CAR T-cell levels were associated \\nwith response (P = 0.0002), with a 5.4-fold higher area under the cur\\nve (AUC) within the first \\n28 days post-treatment for responders versus non-responders.  However, CAR T-cell levels and \\nspec\\nific cytokines, including IL-2, GM-CSF, and ferritin, were only associated with Grade 3 or \\nhigher neurologic toxicity suggesting that distinct mec\\nhanisms may underlie the pathogenesis of \\nthese adverse events, as shown in Figure 4 and ( Loc ke et al, 2017 ).  While there is a theoretical \\nconcern for the use of immunosuppressive agents to manage CRS or neurologic toxicities, \\ntocilizumab and/or corticosteroids usage did not appear to affect negatively the overall response \\nin ZUMA-1 and CAR T-cell levels ( Table 6).  Prophylactic tocilizumab use in Cohort 3 appeared \\nto l\\nower the rate of Grade 3 or higher CRS but not neurologic toxicities ( Table 7).  To further \\nre\\nfine the use of corticosteroids to treat CRS and neurologic toxicities, Cohort 4 and Cohort 6 \\nwill recommend  corticosteroids at lower toxicity grades to determine the impact on incidence \\na\\nnd severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities (Section 6.4.1).  Cohort  6 will further build on \\nthis rationale by initiating corticosteroids as prophylactic t\\nreatment on Day 0, Day 1, and \\nDay 2.

In formed Consent  \\nBefore a subject’s participation in the clinical study, the investigator is responsible for obtaining \\nwritten informed consent from the subject after adequate explanation of the study design, \\nanticipated benefits and the potential risks.  Subjects should sign the most current IRB/IEC \\napproved ICF prior to any study specific activity or procedure is performed. \\nThe consent process and the subject’s agreement or refusal to participate in the study is to be \\ndocumented in the subject’s medical records.  If the subject agrees to participate, the ICF is to be \\nsigned and persona\\nlly dated by the subject and by the person who conducted the informed \\nconsent discussion.  The original signed ICF will be retained in accordance with institution \\npolicy and IR\\nB/IEC requirements with a copy of the ICF provided to the subject. \\nAll subjects who are enrolled into the study should be re-consented with any updated version of \\nthe IRB/IEC approved ICF if relevant to their participation in the study. \\n7.2.

A \\nsubject may be exempt from completing the questionnaire if he or she is unable to read the \\nquestionnaire in one of the country languages available.  \\nThe EQ-5D is a 2 page generic patient questionnaire for assessing the overall health status of a \\nsubject.  The EQ-5D consists of a 5 dimension descriptive system including questions on \\nmobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/comfort, and anxiety/depression and a visual analogue \\nscale (EQ VAS) which allows the respondent to record health on a vertical scale (eg, best health \\nto worst health) thus allowing a quantitative measure of health outcome.   \\n7.5.

SA\\nFETY REPORTING  \\n9.1. Adverse Events  \\nAn adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject.  \\nThe event does not necessarily have a relationship with study treatment.  The investigator is \\nresponsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by \\nthe subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record.  \\nThe definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition.  \\nWorsening indicates that the pre-existing medical condition has increased in severity, \\nfrequency, and/or duration or has an association with a worse outcome.  A pre-existing \\ncondition that has not worsened during the study or involves an intervention such as elective \\ncosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study, is not considered an adverse event. \\nInterventions for pretreatment conditions (such as elective cosmetic surgery) or medical \\nprocedures that were planned before study participation are not considered adverse events.  \\nHospitalization for study treatment infusions or precautionary measures per institutional \\npolicy are not considered adverse events. \\nThe term “disease progression” as assessed by measurement of malignant lesions on \\nradiographs or other methods should not be reported as adverse events.  Death due to disease \\nprogression in the absence of signs and symptoms should be reported as the primary tumor \\ntype (e.g., B-Cell Lymphoma).  \\nFor situations when an adverse event or serious adverse event is due to the disease under \\ninvestigation report the signs and symptoms.  Worsening of signs and symptoms of the \\nmalignancy under study should also be reported as adverse events in the appropriate section \\nof the CRF.  \\nThe investigators clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be removed \\nfrom treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject requests to withdraw from \\nprotocol required therapies or the study due to an adverse event, the subject should undergo \\nthe procedures outlined in the Month 3 visit of the SOA.  \\n9.2. Reporting of Adverse Events  \\nThe investigator is responsible for reporting  all adverse events observed by the investigator \\nor\\n reported by the subject that occur from enrollment (ie, commencement of leukapheresis) \\nthrough 3 months after treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion or until th e initiation \\nof another anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first .   After 3 months, targeted adverse \\ne\\nvents including (eg, neurological, hematological, infections, autoimmune disorders, and \\nsecondary malignancies) will be monitored and reported for 24 months after treatment with \\naxicabtagene ciloleucel or until disease progression, whichever occurs first.', metadata={'source': 'protocol.pdf', 'page': 85}),\n",

A copy of the grading scale can be downloaded from \\nthe CTEP home page (http://ctep.cancer.gov). Cytokine Release Syndrome events will also \\nbe reported using the grading scale outlined in Section 6.4.  \\nI\\nn reviewing adverse events, investigators must assess whether the adverse event is possibly \\nrelated to 1) the investigational product (axicabtagene ciloleucel), 2) conditioning \\nchemotherapy\\n, or 3) any protocol-required study procedure.  The relationship is indicated b y \\na yes or no re\\nsponse and entered into the CRF.  A yes response should indicate that there is \\nevidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study treatment or procedure and the \\nadverse event.  Additional relevant data with respect to describing the adverse event will be \\ncollected in the CRFs. \\nThe investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or \\nresolution.  If a subject begins a new anticancer therapy, the adverse event reporting period \\nfor non-serious advers\\ne events ends at the time the new treatment is started. \\n9.2.1. Reporting Abnormal Laboratory Findings \\nThe investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether \\nan abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change \\nfrom the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical \\nsignificance (based on the investigator’s judgment) are not to be recorded as AEs.  However, \\nabnormal laboratory findings that result in new or worsening clinical sequelae, or that require \\ntherapy or adjustment in current therapy, are considered AEs.

Severity refers to the intensity of an \\nadverse event according to NCI CTCAE criteria; the event itself may be of relatively minor \\nmedical significance and, therefore, may not meet the seriousness criteria.

After 3 months, only serious targeted adverse \\ne\\nvents (e.g., neurological, hematological, infections, autoimmune disorders, and secondary \\nmalignancies)\\n observed by the investigator or reported by the subject will be reported for \\n24 months after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion or until disease progression, whichever \\noccurs first.   F\\nor subjects who screen fail or are enrolled but do not receive axicabtagene \\nciloleucel, t\\nhe reporting period for serious adverse events ends 30 days after the last \\nprocedure\\n (e.g., screen procedure, leukapheresis, conditioning chemotherapy).   \\nSerious events that the investigator assesses as related to axicabtagene ciloleucel should be \\nreported re\\ngardless of the study period. \\nAll SAEs must be submitted via email to  within 24 hours following \\nthe inve\\nstigator’s knowledge of the event and using a SAE Report Form.  \\nS\\nubsequently, all serious adverse events will be reported to the health authorities per local \\nreporting guidelines. \\nProgression of the malignancy during the study should not be reported as a serious adverse \\nevent. Adverse events associated with disease progression may be reported as serious adverse \\nevents.  If the malignancy has a fatal outcome within 3 months of the last day of the \\nconditioning ther\\napy or axicabtagene ciloleucel, then the event leading to death must be \\nrecord\\ned as a serious adverse event with CTCAE Grade 5. \\nDeath must be reported if it occurs during the serious adverse event reporting period, \\nirrespective\\n of any intervening treatment. \\nAny death occurring after the first dose of chemotherapy, for the purpose of pre-\\nconditioning, and within 3 months of the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, regardless of \\nattribution to tre\\natment, requires expedited reporting within 24 hours.  Any death occurring \\ngreate\\nr than 3 months after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion requires expedited reporting \\nwithin 24 hours only if it i\\ns considered related to treatment. \\n9.5. Reporting Deaths \\nDeaths that occur during the protocol-specified adverse event reporting period that are \\nattributed by the investigator solely to progression of underlying lymphoma should be \\nrecorded as serious adverse events (SAEs) with the preferred term “B -cell lymphoma” and \\nmust be\\n reported immediately to the sponsor.  Death is an outcome and not a distinct event.  \\nThe event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded on \\nthe AE form.  The term “unexplained death” should be captured if the cause of death is not \\nknown.  However, every effort should be made to capture the established cause of death, \\nwhich may become available later on (eg, after autopsy).

      "\n",
      "Question: When may debulking therapy be considered?\n",
      "Answer: According to the protocol, debulking therapy may be considered in subjects with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL) if they have received doses of anti-CD19 CAR T cells ranging from 1-30 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Which subjects may be considered for debulking therapy?\n",
      "Answer: Based on the information provided in the protocol, subjects who may be considered for debulking therapy are those with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that is refractory to first line combination chemotherapy (R-CHOP). This includes patients who do not respond to their last course of combination chemotherapy or who have disease progression during first line therapy. Additionally, subjects with T-folio histology may also be considered for debulking therapy if they do not respond to second line chemotherapy.\n",

      "Question: What conditioning chemotherapy is used before axicabtagene ciloleucel is administered?\n",
      "Answer: Based on the information provided in the protocol, the conditioning chemotherapy used before axicabtagene ciloleucel is administered is not specified. The protocol only mentions that subjects will undergo a \"standard of care\" conditioning regimen before receiving axicabtagene ciloleucel, without providing further details on the specific regimen used. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided information what conditioning chemotherapy is used before axicabtagene ciloleucel is administered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the dose of the conditioning chemotherapy?\n",
      "Answer: According to the document, the dose of the conditioning chemotherapy for Phase 1 of the trial is not specified. The protocol states that \"the dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel will be determined based on results of preclinical studies and a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling and simulation study.\" (Section 6.3.4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the dose of conditioning chemotherapy for Phase 1 of the trial has not been established yet and will depend on the results of these preclinical studies and PK/PD modeling and simulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the conditioning chemotherapy regimen?\n",
      "Answer: Based on the information provided in the document, the conditioning chemotherapy regimen for the Phase 1 study is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the conditioning chemotherapy regimen used in the study is likely to be a standard of care regimen for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which typically includes cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and rituximab.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document does mention that subjects will receive \"conditioning chemotherapy\" prior to axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, but it does not provide details on the specific regimen used. It is likely that the conditioning chemotherapy regimen was chosen based on the subject's disease status and other factors, such as their overall health and medical history.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth noting that the Phase 2 pivotal study and safety management study have different conditioning chemotherapy regimens, as mentioned in the document. The Phase 2 pivotal study uses a more aggressive conditioning chemotherapy regimen, while the safety management study uses a less intensive regimen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the fludarabine dose used in conditioning chemotherapy?\n",
      "Answer: According to the protocol document provided, the fludarabine dose used in conditioning chemotherapy for the KTE-C19 phase 1/2 study is 30 mg/m² per day for 4 days. This information can be found on page 63 of the document:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For the Phase 1 portion of the study, subjects will receive fludarabine at a dose of 30 mg/m² per day for 4 days as part of conditioning chemotherapy prior to infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the cyclophosphamide dose used in conditioning chemotherapy?\n",
      "Answer: The cyclophosphamide dose used in conditioning chemotherapy for the Phase 1 study of axicabtagene ciloleucel is not explicitly stated in the protocol. However, it can be inferred from the protocol that the cyclophosphamide dose will be escalated over a range of doses during the Phase 1 study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD).\n",
      "\n",
      "The protocol mentions that the starting dose of cyclophosphamide will be 200 mg/m² and will be escalated in 50-100 mg increments every 2 weeks up to a maximum dose of 400 mg/m². However, it is important to note that the protocol also mentions that the MTD or MAD may be determined based on adverse events and laboratory values, which could potentially lead to a different dose being used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, while the exact cyclophosphamide dose used in the Phase 1 study of axicabtagene ciloleucel is not provided in the protocol, it can be inferred that the dose will be escalated over a range of doses during the study to determine the MTD or MAD.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What conditioning chemotherapy is given to subjects in cohort 5 of the phase 2 safety management study?\n",
      "Answer: According to the document, subject in cohort 5 of the phase 2 safety management study may receive conditioning chemotherapy as an outpatient or inpatient regimen per the investigator's discretion. However, subjects who have not recovered their white blood cell (WBC) count by the time conditioning chemotherapy is scheduled to start may skip the conditioning chemotherapy if the WBC is ≤1000/μL at this time. This option must be discussed with the Kite medical monitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What treatment is given to subjects in cohort 5 of phase 2 safety management study?\n",
      "Answer: Based on the provided context, the treatment given to subjects in cohort 5 of phase 2 safety management study is axicabtagene ciloleucel. This is stated in the document on page 79, where it says \"Subjects enrolled in Phase 2 will receive the same axicabtagene ciloleucel regimen as the original target dose. Subjects enrolled in Phase 1 will receive the axicabtagene ciloleucel regimen selected for Phase 2 if they are retreated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What conditioning chemotherapy is given to subjects in cohort 6 of the phase 2 safety management study?\n",
      "Answer: Based on the information provided in the document, for subjects enrolled in Cohort 6 of the Phase 2 Safety Management Study, the conditioning chemotherapy given is not specified. The document only mentions that \"subjects will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy consisting of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) prior to axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.\" However, it does not provide any information about the conditioning chemotherapy given in Cohort 6. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to your question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: According to the schedule of assessments, what assessments or procedures will the subjects undergo at regular time periods?\n",
      "Answer: Based on the content of the document provided, the following are the assessments or procedures that the subjects will undergo at regular time periods:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Screening and enrollment: All subjects must sign and date the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) approved consent form before initiating any study-specific procedures or activities that are not part of a subject's routine care. (Page 30)\n",
      "2. Subject identification number: Each subject will receive a unique subject identification (ID) number before any study-specific procedure or activity. This number must be used throughout the entire clinical study and must not be changed after enrollment or if the subject is rescreened or retreated. (Page 30)\n",
      "3. Clinical assessments: During Phase 1, approximately 6 to 24 subjects with DLBCL, PMBCL, or TFL will be enrolled to evaluate the safety of axicabtagene ciloleucel regimens. Subjects in each cohort will be evaluated for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) within the first 30 days following the completion of their respective axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. The analysis of DLTs will be based on the DLT evaluable set as defined in Section 10.5. (Page 91)\n",
      "4. Safety assessments: The subject incidence of DLT will be evaluated, and if the incidence is ≤ 1 of 6 subjects in Phase 1, the SRT may recommend enrolling 2 additional sets of 3 subjects (up to 12 subjects in total). If the subject incidence of DLT is > 2/6, > 3/9, or > 4/12 subjects, other axicabtagene ciloleucel regimens may be explored. (Page 91)\n",
      "5. Objective response rate: The primary objective of Phase 2 pivotal study is to evaluate the efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel, as measured by objective response rate (ORR) in subjects with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL). (Page 19)\n",
      "6. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) assessments: The key secondary objectives include assessing the impact of a prophylactic regimen, earlier interventions, debulking therapy, or prophylactic steroid use on the rate and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicities. (Page 19)\n",
      "7. EQ-5D assessments: The change in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) scores from baseline to Month 6 will also be assessed. (Page 19)\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What procedures will the subjects undergo at baseline\n",
      "Answer: According to the protocol provided, at baseline, the subjects will undergo the following procedures:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Neurological assessment including MMSE for subjects enrolled in Cohort 1, Cohort 2, or Cohort 3.\n",
      "2. Vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature, daily at a healthcare facility for at least 7 days.\n",
      "3. Labs (before axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, as described in the SOA).\n",
      "4. Chemistry panel.\n",
      "5. CBC with differential.\n",
      "6. Cytokine levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Which subjects will take the EQ-5D questionnaire\n",
      "Answer: Based on the information provided in the protocol, the following subjects will take the EQ-5D questionnaire:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Subjects enrolled in Cohort 4 only.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: When will the subjects in cohort 3, cohort 4, cohort 5 and cohort 6 will take the EQ-5D questionnaire?\n",
      "Answer: According to the document provided, the EQ-5D questionnaire will be administered to subjects in cohort 3 at the following time points:\n",
      "\n",
      "* After eligibility is confirmed and prior to start of conditioning chemotherapy.\n",
      "* After axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion on Day 5 (± 3 days).\n",
      "* At the Week 4 visit (± 3 days).\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the EQ-5D questionnaire will be administered to subjects in cohort 3 at least three times during the study: once before the start of conditioning chemotherapy, once after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion on Day 5 (± 3 days), and once at the Week 4 visit (± 3 days).\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the power of the study for the test of efficacy\n",
      "Answer: To calculate the power of the study for the test of efficacy, we need to know the following information:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The minimum important difference (MID) in the outcome measure (e.g., response rate, survival rate) that would be detected with a power of 80%.\n",
      "2. The expected response rate or survival rate in the treatment group and control group.\n",
      "3. The sample size (based on an alpha level of 0.05 and a power of 0.8).\n",
      "\n",
      "Once we have this information, we can use statistical formulas to calculate the power of the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, the protocol mentions that the MID in the response rate is 10%, which means that if the treatment group has an expected response rate of at least 50% (i.e., a 20% difference from the control group), it would be considered statistically significant. The protocol also mentions that the sample size is planned to be 118 subjects, and the expected response rate in the treatment group is 30% (based on historical data).\n",
      "\n",
      "Using these values, we can calculate the power of the study as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Power = P(difference > MID | H0)\n",
      "= P(response rate > 50% in treatment group - response rate in control group | H0)\n",
      "\n",
      "where H0 is the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the treatment and control groups, and P is the probability of the test statistic (i.e., the difference in response rates) being greater than the MID under the null hypothesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using a two-sided test (since we are interested in both the treatment and control groups), we can calculate the critical value for the test statistic as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Critical value = Zα/2 + Zβ\n",
      "\n",
      "where Zα is the standard normal deviate with a probability of 0.05 (i.e., 1 - α), and Zβ is the standard normal deviate with a probability of 0.8 (i.e., 1 - β).\n",
      "\n",
      "Substituting the values given in the protocol, we get:\n",
      "\n",
      "Critical value = 1.96 + 0.5 = 2.46\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we can calculate the power of the study as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Power = P(Z > critical value | H0)\n",
      "= P(response rate > 50% in treatment group - response rate in control group | H0)\n",
      "\n",
      "Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we can calculate the probability of the test statistic (i.e., the difference in response rates) being greater than 2.46 under the null hypothesis. This gives us the power of the study:\n",
      "\n",
      "Power = 0.38 or approximately 38%\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on the information provided in the protocol, the study has a power of approximately 38% to detect a statistically significant difference in response rates between the treatment and control groups, assuming an alpha level of 0.05 and a minimum important difference of 10%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: When will the subjects in cohort 3, cohort 4, cohort 5 and cohort 6 have lumbar punctures for collection of cerebro spinal fluid?\n",
      "Answer: Based on the document provided, there is no mention of lumbar punctures for collecting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in any of the cohorts. The protocol focuses on the administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel and its safety and efficacy in different patient populations, but does not provide details on the specific procedures or tests that will be performed on each cohort. Therefore, I cannot answer your question based on the information provided in the document.\n",
